2024 Pixar film Inside Out 2 is a 2024 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures . The sequel to Inside Out (2015), it was directed by Kelsey Mann (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Mark Nielsen, from a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein, and a story conceived by Mann and LeFauve.

The film tells the story of Rile's emotions as they find themselves joined by new emotions that want to take over Rile's head. First announced in September 2022 during the D23 Expo , Inside Out 2 features Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter's "five to 27 emotions" idea from the first film that Mann pitched during its production to utilize "truthful" worldbuilding . Like its predecessor, the production team consulted psychologists to accurately portray how teenager' emotions change during puberty, while also enlisting a group of teenagers to accurately portray modern teenage life. Inside Out 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 10, 2024, and was released in theaters in the United States on June 14. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $1.234 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 . It had the third-biggest domestic opening weekend for an animated film, and became the fastest animated film to cross the $1 billion mark, alongside being the sixth-highest-grossing animated film of all time. Plot Two years after moving to San Francisco, 13-year-old Riley is about to enter high school. Her personified emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust — now oversee a newly-formed element of Rile's mind called her "Sense of Self", which houses memories and feelings that shape her beliefs. Joy, aiming to fill the Sense of Self with only positive memories, creates a mechanism that launches negative memories to the back of Rile's mind. Riley and her best friends, Bree and Grace, are invited to a weekend ice hockey camp where Riley hopes to qualify for her schoo's team, the Firehawks. The night before camp, a "Puberty Alarm" goes off, and a group of mind workers clumsily upgrade the emotion console, leaving Headquarters in disarray. The emotions find that Riley overreacts to any inputs they make. Four new emotions — Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui — arrive and clash with the original emotions over their approaches. Joy wants Riley to have fun at camp, while Anxiety focuses on winning a spot on the team and making new friends, especially after learning that Bree and Grace will attend a different high school. While Joy is in control, Riley inadvertently gets the campers punished by the strict camp director, Coach Roberts. Anxiety, deciding that Riley needs to change to fit in with the older players, launches the Sense of Self to the back of Rile's mind and has the original emotions captured and thrown into a memory vault. The new emotions then create a new anxiety-dominated Sense of Self and encourage Riley to befriend popular hockey player Val Ortiz, straining her friendship with Bree and Grace. The old emotions escape the vault; Sadness returns to Headquarters while the others go to retrieve Rile's old Sense of Self. Under Anxiet's control, Riley sneaks into Coach Robert' office and learns from her notebook that she is't considered ready to become a Firehawk. The old emotions find the mountain of negative memories deposited by Jo's mechanism and cause an avalanche that not only expedites their return to headquarters but also causes the negative memories to spill into Rile's current Sense of Self. Anxiety realizes that the Sense of Self she has created for Riley is one of self-doubt, which causes Riley to perform poorly during her final tryout match, accidentally hurt Grace, and get sent to the penalty box . Horrified, Anxiety frantically swarms the console in a blinding whirlwind, causing Riley to suffer from a panic attack . With the help of Sadness and a reformed Embarrassment, the other original emotions return to Headquarters. Joy finds Anxiety still in control but in paralysis ; Joy convinces Anxiety that Riley does't need to change to have a better future. Anxiety relents and Joy reinstates Rile's original Sense of Self, but the panic attack persists. After the repentant Anxiety admits that she cannot determine who Riley is, Joy realizes that the same applies to her. She removes the first Sense of Self and allows a new one to form from Rile's positive and negative memories. The emotions embrace this third Sense of Self, calming Riley and helping her reconcile with Bree and Grace. Joy takes command and helps Riley happily finish the game. Riley befriends Val and the other Firehawks at high school while staying true to herself and maintaining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Living in peace, the original and new emotions work together to protect Riley, who checks her phone for the Firehawk' recruitment results and looks at herself in the mirror with a proud smile.

Production Development After the success of Inside Out , the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015 , Entertainment Tonight and The Guardian considered a sequel to be "inevitable".    Inside Out director Pete Docter was germinating ideas for a sequel while the original fil's nominations were unveiled at the 88th Academy Awards in January 2016.  Development on the story began in early 2020 and Pixar officially confirmed the seque's development during the D23 Expo announcement in September 2022, with Amy Poehler coming on stage to discuss the film alongside Docter.  Kelsey Mann was announced as the director of the sequel (making it his feature directorial debut), with Mark Nielsen producing, while Meg LeFauve was announced to write the fil's screenplay, returning from its predecessor.  To utilize "truthful" worldbuilding , Mann used Docte's "five to 27 emotions" idea from the first film that he pitched during its production.  Man's first pass included nine new emotions to make Joy feel overwhelmed with all the new emotions showing up, but felt that the story could not keep track with so many emotions taking the spotlight or not adding to the story, so after the first screening, he decided to simplify the number. Among those emotions was Schadenfreude (having joy at someon's expense), Jealousy and Guilt, but the latter two influenced the film despite being removed, with Mann feeling that Envy could relate to Jealousy and how remnants of Guilt could be found within Anxiet's introduction, even giving Anxiety some of Guil's baggage, which was inspired by that of Disneyland hotels.  Research and writing The production team frequently consulted author and clinical psychologist Lisa Damour and used her books as guidance on accurately portraying how teenager' emotions change during puberty. Professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley , Dacher Keltner , who helped on the first Inside Out , returned as a consultant as well. Keltner played a key role in selecting which emotions should be introduced in the story. A character based on the emotion of shame was intended to be a part of the film but was axed, in part due to Keltner contesting that shame was not an emotion.  To assist with the development of the film, Pixar enlisted a group of nine teenagers, who were dubbed "Rile's Crew", to provide feedback on the film to ensure it accurately portrayed modern teenage life. Their input led to the inclusion of the emotion Nostalgia and influenced various scenes, including everyday elements of the emotion' lives and the transition from middle school to high school.   Nielsen and Mann were also inspired by their own daughters when crafting the film. As development on the story began during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic , the two were able to gather personal research from studying their children, some of whom were Rile's age in the film. Their perspective as parents helped in shaping the film and characterizing the emotions, especially Joy.  Initially, the plot of the film was to involve a talent show, but that idea ended up being scrapped. After about three test screenings, Nielsen, Mann, and LeFauve decided it was best to center the story on Riley playing hockey, as they felt it was a unique aspect of her character. The decision was also influenced by input Mann received from Turning Red director Domee Shi when he asked how to make the film unique from other teenage coming-of-age stories, including her own.  The scene where the old emotions are locked in a vault was originally longer but was trimmed down as several gags were cut out due to time constraints.  Casting Poehler accepted an offer of $5 million with lucrative bonuses to reprise her role as Joy from the first film . Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black also reprise their roles from the first film, voicing Sadness and Anger, respectively.  Following a dispute over pay, both Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling declined to reprise their respective roles as Fear and Disgust; they and the rest of the returning cast were reportedly offered $100,000 each, equivalent to two percent of Poehle's salary.  On November 9, 2023, with the release of the teaser trailer, it was revealed that Tony Hale and Liza Lapira would replace Hader and Kaling as Fear and Disgust, respectively, while Maya Hawke joined the cast as Anxiety, a new emotion.  Mann auditioned Hawke via Zoom at the office of a back room in Epcot during a family vacation with his kids after Nielsen told him that Hawke was available to audition just then, with her anxious performance driving him to tears.  On January 16, 2024, it was revealed that June Squibb had joined the cast in an undisclosed role,  later revealed to be Nostalgia.  On March 7, 2024, Disney revealed that Ayo Edebiri , Adèle Exarchopoulos , Paul Walter Hauser , Kensington Tallman, Diane Lane , and Kyle MacLachlan joined the cast, with Edebiri, Exarchopoulos, and Hauser playing the other new emotions, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment, respectively.  In addition, Tallman replaces Kaitlyn Dias as Riley Andersen, while Lane reprises her role as Mrs. Andersen, and MacLachlan also reprises his role as Mr. Andersen.  John Ratzenberger reprises his role as Fritz, marking his first voice role in a Pixar film since Onward .  Also joining the cast in supporting roles are Lilimar , who plays a hockey player named Valentina, and Yvette Nicole Brown , who plays the coach of the hockey team, while Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu play Bree and Grace, Rile's friends.   Music Main article: Inside Out 2 (soundtrack) On March 7, 2024, with the release of the second trailer, it was reported that Andrea Datzman had composed the fil's score, taking over for Michael Giacchino .  This made Datzman the first woman to score a Pixar feature film.   The soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on June 14, 2024, the same day as the film.  Release Inside Out 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 10, 2024,  and was released in theaters in the United States four days later.  It also screened at the 2024 Annecy International Animation Film Festival that same day.  The film was screened in various formats, including RealD 3D , IMAX and Dolby Cinema .  Marketing The teaser trailer for the film, along with the poster, was released on November 9, 2023. James Withbrook of Gizmodo and Inverse's Rotem Rusak highlighted the introduction of three other emotions in the poster: Embarrassment, Ennui, and Envy.   The teaser was viewed over 157 million times in the first 24 hours across all social media platforms—including over 78 million from TikTok —becoming the most-watched animated film trailer launch in the Walt Disney Company's history  , surpassing the previous record holder, Frozen II (2019).  A clip from the film was also aired during the Super Bowl LVIII , named "Team".  The second trailer, along with a new poster, was released on March 7, 2024.  This trailer also marked the debut of the "standard" variant of the 2023 Walt Disney Pictures logo, which was introduced the year before for the studi's centennial anniversary.  The first 35 minutes of the film were screened during the Walt Disney Studios' presentation of first looks at their 2024 theatrical release slate at CinemaCon on April 11, 2024.  As part of a partnership with Airbnb , a new rental home in Nevada just outside of Las Vegas modeled after "headquarters" in the film was listed on the website beginning June 12, 2024.  Reception Box office As of July 9, 2024  , Inside Out 2 has grossed $537.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $696.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.234 billion.   On a budget of $200 million, Inside Out 2 was initially projected to gross $80–90 million in its domestic opening weekend. The sub-$100 million industry projections were partially due to the notion that general audiences remained hesitant to return to theaters, given the direct-to-streaming releases of the Pixar films Soul (2020), Luca (2021), and Turning Red (2022) on Disney+ , the underperformance of Pixa's Lightyear at the box office in 2022, and the lackluster box office results of several films in 2024.    After making $63.6 million on its first day,  including an estimated $13 million from Thursday night previews, projections were raised to $140–150 million for the weekend.  It ended up grossing $154.2 million domestically from 4,440 theaters and an estimated $140 million from 38 international markets, for a worldwide debut of $294.2 million, the highest in Pixar history.   In the United States and Canada, the $154.2 million opening weekend was the best of 2024, surpassing Dune: Part Two ($82.5 million) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire ($80 million) to become the first film of the year to open above $100 million, and the third-best for an animated film behind Pixa's own Incredibles 2 (2018; $182.7 million) and Disne's The Lion King (2019; $191.7 million).  It was also the fourth-best opening for a PG film after The Lion King , Incredibles 2 , and Beauty and the Beast ($174 million). With an average ticket price of $12.53 overall and $10.36 for children, twelve million moviegoers saw the film in its first weekend, nearing the thirteen million admissions for Barbie (2023) in its first three days. It played strongly throughout the day (22% of viewers attended before 1 pm, 35% between 1 pm and 5 pm, 26% between 5 pm and 8 pm, and 17% after 8 pm), benefiting from substantial walk-up business credited to its multi-cultural pull (of the opening weekend audience, 36% identified as Hispanic and Latino). IMAX and Premium Large Formats (PLFs) accounted for 43% of the earnings, while 14% came from 3D showings.    The film found momentum during the weekday, bringing its seven-day total to $255.2 million and reaching multiple box-office milestones,  including the second highest-grossing first Monday for a Pixar film (at $22.4 million),   the highest-grossing first Tuesday for an animated film (at $28.8 million),   the third highest non-opening Wednesday after Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015; $38 million) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019; $32.2 million) that doubled as a record for the Juneteenth federal holiday since it began in 2021 (at $30.1 million),   and the highest-grossing first Thursday for a Pixar film (at $19.6 million).   The film made $101.2 million in its second weekend, a mere 34.4% drop to become the most profitable second weekend for an animated film, topping the $92.3 million earned by The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023), and the seventh-best second weekend overall. Deadline Hollywood' s Anthony 'Alessandro attributed the feat to heat waves and rainstorms prompting people to visit air-conditioned theaters.   During its third weekend, it beat newcomer A Quiet Place: Day One to remain at the top of the box office with $57.5 million.   On the Fourth of July , it crossed $500 million domestically, and during its fourth weekend, the film made $33.1 million, finishing in second behind Despicable Me 4 .  Worldwide, the film surpassed the gross of its predecessor ($859 million) on June 27, 2024, after sixteen days of release.  On June 30, the film crossed the $1 billion threshold, being the first Disney animated film to do so since Frozen II in 2019. From this, Inside Out 2 became the animated film to cross $1 billion the fastest, doing so in 19 days and beating out The Lion King (21 days).   Critical response On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 91% of 285 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The websit's consensus reads: "Spicing things up with the wrinkle of teen angst, Inside Out 2 clears the head and warms the heart by living up to its predecesso's emotional intelligence."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale (the same as the first film), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave the film an average of 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 71% saying they would definitely recommend it.  Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times awarded the film 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 stars out of four, commending the voice cast and the film as "a happy head trip, for any age".  Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five, praising the animation, metaphors, and wit while saying "the cast-iron ontological brilliance of Docte's original premise bears expansion well".  Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised Hawk's performance as Anxiety and the fil's emotional impact, calling it "the most poignantly perceptive tale of the conundrums of early adolescence since Eighth Grade ".  David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a'C' rating, writing that the film "so perfectly ticks Pixa's boxes in a way that forces the sincerity of its storytelling into a losing battle with the cynicism of its existence".

Development began after Legendary Entertainment acquired film and television rights for the Dune franchise in 2016. Villeneuve signed on as director in 2017, intending to make a two-part adaptation of the novel due to its complexity. Production contracts were only secured for the first film, with the second film having to be greenlit based on the firs's success. After the critical and commercial success of the first film, Legendary green-lit Dune: Part Two in October 2021. Principal photography took place in Budapest, Italy, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi between July and December 2022. After being delayed from an original November 2023 release date due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes , the film premiered at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City , on February 6, 2024, and was released in the United States on March 1, to critical acclaim. It set several box office records and has grossed over $712 million worldwide, surpassing its predecessor and making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2024 and the highest-grossing film in Villeneuv's career. A sequel based on Herber's 1969 novel Dune Messiah is in development. Plot [ edit ] Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen , Princess Irulan , the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV , journals about her fathe's betrayal of the Atreides. On Arrakis , Stilgar's Fremen troops accompany Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica , to Sietch Tabr . Some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis. The Fremen accept Paul but Stilgar tells Jessica she must succeed Sietch Tab's dying Reverend Mother by drinking the Water of Life —a drug fatal for males and untrained women. She uses her Bene Gesserit training to transmute the liquid and survive, inheriting the memories of all past Reverend Mothers. The liquid prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia , allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, correctly believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen, but Chani begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them. Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm , and raiding Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names "Usul" and "Mua'Dib". Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Rabban , as Arraki's ruler with his cunning and psychopathic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha . Lady Margot Fenring , a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and secure his genetic lineage. Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe most strongly in the prophecy. Paul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south as a messiah . During a raid on a smuggler spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck , who leads Paul to the hidden atomic warhead stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but Jessica compels her to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens Paul. Now possessing a partial clairvoyance across space and time, Paul sees an adult Alia on water-filled Arrakis. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures, and that Jessica is Baron Harkonne's daughter. Paul meets with the southern Fremen war council, galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar . As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Paul executes the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Meanwhile, Gurney leads an assault on Arrakeen, intercepting and killing Rabban. Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chan's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit, ready to invade the planet, but Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomic weapons if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shadda's champion, and Paul kills him in a duel. Irulan agrees to Pau's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam surrenders, but the Great Houses reject Pau's ascendancy, so he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Pau's holy war. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm.

In November 2016, Legendary Pictures obtained the film and TV rights for the Dune franchise , based on the eponymous 1965 novel by Frank Herbert .  Vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary Mary Parent began discussing with Denis Villeneuve about directing a film adaptation, quickly hiring him after realizing his passion for Dune .  In February 2018, Villeneuve was confirmed to be hired as director, and intended to adapt the novel as a two-part film series.   Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-film deal with Warner Bros. Pictures , in the same style as the two-part adaption of Stephen King's It in 2017 and 2019 .  In January 2019, Joe Walker was confirmed as the fil's editor.  Other crew included Brad Riker as supervising art director, Patrice Vermette as production designer, Paul Lambert as visual effects supervisor, Gerd Nefzer as special effects supervisor, and Thomas Struthers as stunt coordinator.  Dune: Part Two was produced by Villeneuve, Mary Parent , and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert , Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull , Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison , and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant.  Legendary CEO Joshua Grode confirmed in April 2019 that they plan to make a sequel, adding that "ther's a logical place to stop the  movie before the book is over".  In December 2020, Villeneuve stated that due to Warner Bros' plan to release the film in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously, the first film could underperform financially, resulting in cancellation of the planned sequel.  In an IMAX screening of the first fil's first ten minutes, the title logo read Dune: Part One , lending credence to plans for the sequel.  In August 2021, Villeneuve spoke more confidently about the chances of a sequel film, iterating his excitement to work with Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya again,  while stating Chani would have a bigger role in the sequel.  Warner Bros. assured Villeneuve a sequel would be greenlit as long as the film performed well on HBO Max.  Just days prior to the first fil's release, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff stated, "Will we have a sequel to Dune ? If you watch the movie you see how it ends. I think you pretty much know the answer to that."  On October 26, 2021, Legendary officially greenlit Dune: Part Two , with a spokesperson for the company stating, "We would not have gotten to this point without the extraordinary vision of Denis and the amazing work of his talented crew, the writers, our stellar cast, our partners at Warner Bros., and of course the fans! Her's to more Dune ."  Production work had occurred back-to-back with the first film, as Villeneuve and his wife Lapointe immediately took a flight to Budapest in order to begin pre-production work.  A key point of negotiation prior to greenlighting the sequel was assuring that the sequel would have an exclusive window where it would only be shown theatrically, with Legendary and Warner Bros. agreeing to give Dune: Part Two a 45-day window before it would be available through other channels. Villeneuve said this theatrical exclusivity was a "non-negotiable condition", and that "the theatrical experience is at the very heart of the cinematic language for me".  With Dune: Part Two being greenlit, Villeneuve said that his primary concern was to complete the filming as soon as possible, with the earliest he expected to start in the last quarter of 2022. He noted that production would be expedited by the work already done for the first film.  Writing [ edit ] (Left to right) Timothée Chalamet , Zendaya , and Rebecca Ferguson returned as Paul Atreides, Chani, and Lady Jessica, respectively. Eric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay in April 2017 for the Dune films,  and Jon Spaihts was later confirmed to be co-writing the script alongside Roth and Villeneuve.  Game of Thrones language creator David Peterson was confirmed to be developing languages for the film in April 2019.  Villeneuve and Peterson had created the Chakobsa language, which was used by actors on set.  In November 2019, Spaihts stepped down as show-runner for Dune: Prophecy to focus on Dune: Part Two .  In June 2020, Greig Fraser said, "I's a fully formed story in itself with places to go. I's a fully standalone epic film that people will get a lot out of when they see it".  Between the release of Dune and the confirmation of Dune: Part Two , Villeneuve started working the script in a way that production could begin immediately once the film was greenlit.  By February 2021, Roth created a full treatment for the sequel,  with writing beginning that August.  He confirmed that Feyd-Rautha would appear in the film, and stated he will be a "very important character".  In March 2022, Villeneuve had mostly finished writing the screenplay.  Craig Mazin and Roth wrote additional literary material for the film.  Villeneuve stated that the film would continue directly from the first, and specifically described it as being the "second part".  He described the film as being an "epic war movie", adding that while the first film was more "contemplative", the second would feature more action.  Villeneuve sought to anchor the movie to the characters, primarily Paul and Chani. With the two featured in an "epic love story" between them, Villeneuve described them as the "epicenter of the story". Zendaya initially found difficulty in creating dialogue, commenting that "It was funny trying to figure out in this futuristic space talk, like, how do they flirt?" Chalamet also added that Paul would be heavily influenced by Chani, serving as his "moral compass". Paul becomes deeply embedded in Fremen culture, developing a closer bond with Stilgar, who becomes his surrogate father figure and mentor, while tensions emerge between Chani and Lady Jessica, as Chani is aware that Jessic's schemes negatively impact the Fremen.  The script ultimately conveys Chani as a nonbeliever of the prophecy and intended for its structure to first convey their romantic relationship from Pau's perspective, and eventually pivot to Chan's perspective as the audience realizes Pau's desire for power and insidious nature.  He focused on Herber's original intention to depict Paul as an antihero in Dune , on his way to becoming a villain, and wrote the script with that in mind while also considering his future plans regarding Dune Messiah, particularly by modifying Chan's characterization as he felt that she eventually "disappeared in Pau's shadows" in the book.   Feeling he had the "benefit of time" in doing so, Villeneuve decided to use all the elements of Pau's character arc and "play them a bit differently" in order to establish his eventual transformation into a villainous figure and becoming "what he was trying to fight against".  He expanded the role of Chani and Lady Jessica from the novel, and interpreted Chani as being a critique of power.  When envisioning the sandworm sequence, Villeneuve primarily relied upon his own drawings and storyboards, as he felt the book did not contain adequate descriptions. He later cited it as being one of his favorite scenes in the film.  When writing Pau's character arc, he considered Paul as transforming from a "humble" figure to a "dark messianic figure", and took inspiration from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira (1988) when designing the storyboards.  Villeneuve felt the fil's ending was more "tragic" than that of the book, feeling that it adequately resolved Pau's storyline across the Dune films while setting up his character arc for a potential third film based on Dune Messiah (1969).  Following the first film, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is described as being heavily debilitated and reliant upon being submerged in fluids, while focusing on choosing an heir: Glossu "Beast" Rabban or Feyd-Rautha, both his nephews. Rabban was regarded as being a bad strategist, while Feyd-Rautha is shown to be clever, cunning, and charismatic.  Actor Austin Butler felt Feyd-Rauth's character served as "flip sides of the same coin" to Paul, as both had been involved in the Bene Gesseri's genetic breeding program. Butler opined that Feyd-Rauth's upbringing on Giedi Prime and self-care for his body explained his arrogance. Meanwhile, Villeneuve noted his psychopathic personality and brutality similar to that of an animal, contrasted with his "code of honors" and reverence for fighters.  Lady Jessica is heavily traumatized by the death of Duke Leto, being compared to Paul as a "survivor" and strategizing to realize the ambitions of the Bene Gesserit, who aim to fulfill their prophecy to maximize human potential, disregarding morality and ethics. There is additional focus on the political aspect, with Princess Irulan fearing that her father, Emperor Shaddam IV, will lose his throne due to his loss of influence over warring factions.  During the sequence of Pau's consumption of the Water of Life, Villeneuve deliberately altered the timeframe to depict an adult Alia for a dramatic effect, and to highlight Ali's unique birth. He and Spaihts decided to "compress" the time for both the sequence and Lady Jessic's pregnancy in order to establish more narrative tension. He added that Lady Jessic's conversations with an embryonic Alia was unique, as he felt it was "fresh and original to have a character who is powerful and still a pregnant woman" while also conveying how others perceive Alia as an "abomination".  Like Chani and Lady Jessica, Villeneuve further developed Princess Irula's character and motivations from the novel, with actress Florence Pugh noting her reserved nature and intelligence.  Casting [ edit ] (Left to right) Austin Butler , Florence Pugh , and Christopher Walken joined the cast as Feyd-Rautha, Princess Irulan, and Shaddam IV, respectively. In March 2022, Pugh and Butler were reported to be in talks to star in the film as Princess Irulan and Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha , respectively.   Butler was offered the role while having coffee with Villeneuve, without needing to audition. He trained for four months in Budapest , using a fitness regimen made by an ex- Navy SEALs member.   Villeneuve described his performance as being a "cross between a psychopath killer, an Olympic sword master, a snake, and Mick Jagger " while Butler researched past cultures he felt "bred brutality" and took inspiration from various animals including sharks and snakes.   Butler said that he drew inspiration from Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger for his performance.  He imitated Skarsgår's voice as the Baron, as he felt that Feyd would be influenced by the Baron due to growing up with him.  In May, Christopher Walken joined the cast as Shaddam IV .  In June, Léa Seydoux entered negotiations to join the cast as Lady Margot Fenring .  In July, Souheila Yacoub joined the cast as Shishakli.  In January 2023, Tim Blake Nelson was added to the cast in an undisclosed role.  Attending the fil's London premiere in February 2024, Anya Taylor-Joy confirmed that she had been cast in the film.  Villeneuve was surprised that her role had been kept a secret for that long, noting it required "so much work to keep that secret". Her role had been revealed in a casting credit list for the film on Letterboxd .  Filming [ edit ] Pre-shooting began on July 4, 2022, at the Brion tomb in Altivole , Italy for two days.  Principal photography was set to begin on July 21 in Budapest , Hungary,  but began earlier on July 18.   The film was entirely shot using Arri Alexa LF digital cameras , with new filming locations and sets being used "to avoid repetition".  In October 2022, Chalamet took a break from filming in order to attend the premiere of Bones and All (2022).  The production team managed to shoot during the partial solar eclipse of October 25 , and used the footage for the opening fight scene between Harkonnen and Fremen soldiers.  In November, production moved to Abu Dhabi , with Pugh finishing her scenes in November.   Certain scenes set at dawn had to be filmed across three days to take advantage of the golden hour .  A special unit of production filmed scenes with Taylor-Joy in Namibia , the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa .  Filming wrapped on December 12, 2022.  Due to the delays, Villeneuve was able to make a film transfer for projection using the IMAX 70 mm and conventional 70 mm film formats.  Pugh delivered Princess Irula's opening narration during her first day of filming and for overall production.  Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser filmed Feyd-Rauth's gladiator sequence with specially designed black-and-white infrared cameras. They wanted the Harkonnens to cheer and stomp rather than applaud, and designed over 30 sections for spectators in the arena.  Butler spent his first week on set filming the scene, while the set had very high temperatures that caused some people to faint.  He also improvised his kiss scene with the Baron.  For romantic scenes between Paul and Chani, the scenes were primarily filmed in remote locations in Jordan during the golden hour . The scenes were often filmed as quickly as possible, with only a one-hour window being available.  The scene of Pau's sandworm ride was filmed practically on a production unit, separate from the main one, led by producer Tanya Lapointe and a special team. Chalamet filmed his scenes on a platform meant to imitate a portion of the sandworm, with gripping devices serving as the reference for the Fremen hooks. An industrial fan blew sand on set to emulate the desert climate.  Chalamet estimated the scene took over three months to film, with individual shoots occurring over a span of 20–30 minutes. As the actual sandworm was not built and there were no reference shots, the production team designed a small portion of the worm on set and the actors had to physically visualize and imitate riding the sandworm.   Butler and Chalamet separately trained with a Kali instructor in Los Angeles for the climactic battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. They were excited to do the scene, and immediately began practicing once they later met in Budapest. They performed the scene by themselves, including for wide camera shots. Chalamet delivers the monologue entirely in Chakobsa .   Ferguson cited Lady Jessica undergoing the Reverend Mother process as her favorite scene, working with contortionists for the scene and comparing it to an Exorcist film.  Music [ edit ] Hans Zimmer returned to compose the score of Dune: Part Two . Hans Zimmer returned to compose the fil's score after doing so for the previous film .  Zimmer had composed over 90 minutes of music prior to the announcement of the film to help give Villeneuve inspiration when writing.  Two singles were released on February 15, 2024, by WaterTower Music , titled "A Time of Quiet Between the Storms" and "Harvester Attack". The full soundtrack album was released on February 23.  Marketing [ edit ] A teaser trailer for Dune: Part Two was presented during the Warner Bros. panel at CinemaCon on April 27, 2023.   First-look footage of the cast in-character were released online, alongside a teaser poster, on May 2, 2023.  The trailer was released to the public the following day.  Variety called it "breathtaking";  GQ hailed the shots of Paul riding a sandworm as "the standout sequence";  and Fangoria remarked "If yo're not excited for this one, we dunno what to tell you".  Chalamet and Zendaya later discussed and promoted the film at a Warner Bros. presentation at CineEurope on June 21.  A second trailer was released on June 29, 2023.  Chris Evangelista of Film was excited about the appearance of Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV.  Ben Travis of Empire praised the "seismic" and "astounding, none-more-eye-boggling" imagery, feeling the scope to be "particularly expansive" and noted the monochromatic footage depicting Austin Butle's Feyd-Rautha while calling the footage of Christopher Walke's appearance "impactful".  Joshua Rivera of Polygon opined "The trailer, simply put, rocks" and enjoyed the footage present.  The film was promoted during the December 2023 CCXP with Chalamet, Zendaya, Pugh, Butler, and Villeneuve, where over 10 minutes of footage was released.  Additional footage from Dune: Part Two was shown during a limited IMAX theatrical re-release of Christopher Nolan's Tenet (2020), as part of Warner Bros' celebration for the former fil's release.   Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures partnered with Xbox to provide an immersive content suite related to the film, and visual designs inspired by the film being featured on a floating controller, Xbox Series X , and a console holder. Microsoft Flight Simulator also included an expansion pack allowing players to explore Arrakis and pilot the Royal Atreides Ornithopter .  In November 2023, the Sardaukar were added to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) in a collaboration pack.  A month later, Paul and Feyd-Rautha were added as playable operators to its sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023), with an additional Harkonnen soldier skin being announced in March 2024.   In September 2023, McFarlane Toys announced a new line of 7-inch figures modeled after characters from the sequel film.  Legendary Comics will release Dune: Part Two – The Official Movie Graphic Novel with the help of Kickstarter in the same way the previous adaptation was published.  Research conducted by Nikolaj Mathies, CEO of Vievo Media, said the promotional campaign for the film on TikTok included 117 posts over a year leading up to its release, an increase from the first fil's 108. Messages directly from the cast comprised 24% of the content, with videos featuring Zendaya and Chalamet generating significantly higher viewership. Red carpet content was prioritized to appeal to female audiences, a tactic that contributed to an estimated $2 million increase in the opening box office. According to the marketing research company FanBox, 57% of TikTok users are female and hashtags such as #zendaya have garnered billions of views, leading the core audience for Dune to grow significantly, with a 67.5% increase overall from 2.6 million to 8 million and an 84% increase among "superfans".  Promotion in Japan also included a collaboration with Mobile Suit Gundam SEED – specifically, their Freedom film. The collaboration featured an alternate version of Dune: Part Tw' s movie poster featuring Lacus Clyne (voiced by Rie Tanaka in the original and Stephanie Sheh in the English dubbed version) and Kira Yamato ( Sōichirō Hoshi / Max Mittelman ) in place of Chani and Paul respectively.  Popcorn bucket meme [ edit ] A YouTuber holding the popcorn bucket that resulted in viral Internet memes In January 2024, images of a forthcoming Dune -themed popcorn bucket from AMC Theatres went viral and became an Internet meme after its sandworm-inspired design was compared to an artificial vagina .    Reactions to the bucket received millions of views on the social network TikTok ,  and jokes about it were featured on US late night television , including a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live with cast members Marcello Hernandez , Ayo Edebiri , Devon Walker , and Bowen Yang .   The extensive online attention paid to the bucket led the media to ask much of Dune: Part Two' s main cast for their reactions.  Denis Villeneuve said that the bucket was an "insane marketing idea"  that "brought a lot of laughter and joy".  Griffin Newman in The New York Times chalked up the bucke's appeal to the "magic alchemy" that results from an object that so many people become "perversely fascinated" by.  The product was one of several popcorn buckets AMC had designed and released alongside recent films, including character heads for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and "burn books" for Mean Girls .  Over a month after Dune: Part Two' s release, AM's chief content officer stated that "we would have never created [the bucket] knowing it would be celebrated or mocked", but added that they would continue to create collectible popcorn buckets for other films.  At that time, the Dune popcorn buckets were being resold for as high as $175.  In the wake of its viral popularity from that period, Marvel Studios would later announce a bucket of their own for Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) in a similar fashion as producer Kevin Feige described it as "intentionally crude and lewd".  The bucket was fully revealed at the end of May 2024 by the fil's star, Ryan Reynolds on his YouTube channel.  Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] Dune: Part Two was originally scheduled to be released on October 20, 2023,  but was delayed to November 17, 2023,  before moving forward two weeks to November 3, 2023, to adjust to changes in release schedules from other studios.  It was later postponed by over four months to March 15, 2024, due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes .  After the strikes were resolved, the film moved once more up two weeks to March 1, 2024.  Following the success of Oppenheimer (2023) in the format, Dune: Part Two was released in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm format to twelve venues worldwide,  and in standard 5-perforation 70 mm format to 38 venues worldwide.  Dune: Part Two' s world premiere was hosted in the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on February 6, 2024.  Another premiere was held at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on February 15.   On January 16, 2024, the film was shown to a dying man in a palliative care home in the Canadian city of Saguenay , in Denis Villeneuv's native province of Quebec .   The man had expressed a wish to see Dune: Part Two before his death. Josée Gagnon, the cofounder of a company aiming to accompany people at the end of life, relayed his wish to Villeneuve and Tanya Lapointe , his partner and one of the fil's producers, through a viral call-out on Facebook . According to Gagnon, Villeneuve and Lapointe "were very touched".  The pair initially offered to invite the man to see Dune: Part Two in Los Angeles or Montreal , but since he was too weak to travel, Villeneuve eventually decided to send one of his assistants directly to Saguenay with his private laptop.   The film was screened in a room of the care facility, where everyone was required to hand in their cellphones and sign waivers .  The man was in too much pain to watch the entire film and stopped halfway through.  He eventually died on January 25.  This act, which the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to as the actual "world premiere" of the film, was publicly disclosed after its theatrical release.   Home media [ edit ] The film was released digitally on April 16, 2024, and Blu-ray , DVD and Ultra HD Blu-ray on May 14, 2024, by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment .  Dune: Part Two became available to stream on Max on May 21, 2024.  Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] As of May 20, 2024  , Dune: Part Two has grossed $282.1 million in the United States and Canada and $429.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $712 million.   The Hollywood Reporter had estimated that the film would break-even after grossing around $500 million.  The film made over $145 million in IMAX alone globally.  In the United States and Canada, the fil's advanced ticket sales surpassed those of Oppenheimer (2023), and it was projected to gross $65–80 million from 4,050 theaters in its opening weekend.  The film made $32.2 million on its first day, including $12 million from previews on February 25 and 29; IMAX screenings made up $4.5 million (38%) of the early totals.  It went on to debut to $82.5 million,  doubling the first fil's $41 million opening weekend; IMAX screenings made up $18.5 million (23%) of the total, a record for a March release.   According to Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros.,  it was "much higher than any of us could predict", especially for "a genre that is a hard nut to crack".  In its second weekend the film made $46 million (a 44% drop), finishing second behind newcomer Kung Fu Panda 4 . It also surpassed the entire domestic gross of the first film ($108 million) in just seven days.  The film made $28.5 million in its third weekend and $17.6 million in its fourth, remaining in second both times.   It also became Timothée Chalame's highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing Wonka .  Outside the US and Canada, the film was expected to gross $85–90 million from 71 markets in its opening weekend.  It grossed $100.02 million in the first three days.  In its second weekend, the sci-fi epic added $81 million from 72 international markets, including a $20 million opening in China.  Dune: Part Two continued to hold well, grossing $51.2 million and $30.7 million in its third and fourth weekends respectively.   As of April 14, 2024, the highest grossing markets were the United Kingdom ($48.1 million), China ($48.1 million), France ($41.8 million), Germany ($38.7 million), and Australia ($22 million).  Critical response [ edit ] The film "largely received rave reviews from critics",    and was praised for its visual effects and cast performances. Some reviews considered it one of the greatest science fiction films ever made.   On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 92% of 434 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The websit's consensus reads: "Visually thrilling and narratively epic, Dune: Part Two continues Denis Villeneuv's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in spectacular form."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, up from the first fil's "A-," while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 94% overall positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend it.  Richard Roeper , writing for the Chicago Sun-Times , gave the film three stars out of four, praising the technical and narrative aspects, saying, "Even as we marvel at the stunning and immersive and Oscar-level cinematography, editing, score, visual effects, production design and sound in Denis Villeneuv's Dune: Part Two , w're reminded at every turn that this is an absolutely bat-bleep [ sic ] crazy story."  Filmmaker Steven Spielberg praised the film, calling it "one of the most brilliant science fiction films I have ever seen," while further noting that "i's also filled with deeply, deeply drawn characters ... Yet the dialogue is very sparse when you look at it proportionately to the running time of the film. I's such cinema. The shots are so painterly, yet ther's not an angle or single setup tha's pretentious."   Fellow Canadian filmmaker James Cameron also praised the movie, calling it "pure cinema" and stating that i's an improvement over the 1984 adaptation. Other reviews were more mixed in their judgement. In The Hollywood Reporter , Lovia Gyarkye praised the fil's technical aspects and performances, but found it failed to fully adapt the boo's nuance on themes such as imperialism.  Nicholas Barber wrote for the BBC that the film is "one of the most jaw-droppingly weird pieces of art-house psychedelia ever to come from a major studio", finding the fil's grand scale made up for its issues.  At the more negative end, Noah Berlatsky writing for CNN judged that the film had failed to "present an effective anti-colonial vision" by still being centred around Pau's destiny despite an increased voice of opposition from Chani.  Some commentators have criticized the film for failing to adequately deal with the original boo's Middle East and North Africa (MENA) influences or otherwise incorporate enough representation from the region.  Furvah Shah, writing for the UK edition of Cosmopolitan , said she "felt frustrated as a Muslim viewer", criticizing the film for a lack of MENA casting amongst the leads despite the use of the regio's culture and superficial use of Islam.  The New Arab's Hannah Flint also criticized the use of Arab and Islamic cultural items and lack of MENA casting, though did praise that of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souheila Yacoub as a "win for Arab representation".  Steven D. Greydanus, in U.S. Catholic , gives a contrasting view of the fil's religious inspirations, noting that the film draws from a number of Abrahamic religions for the purpose of critiquing faith itself, while also noting the "spiritualization of ecological concerns" through the Fremen.  Accolades [ edit ] Future [ edit ] Villeneuve has repeatedly expressed interest in making a third film based on Dune Messiah , the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended on the success of Dune: Part Two .    Spaihts also reiterated in March 2022 that Villeneuve had plans for a third film as well as the television spin-off series Dune: Prophecy .  In August 2023, Villeneuve said the third film would serve as the conclusion of a trilogy.  Villeneuve began developing a script for the third film in 2023.  In February 2024, Villeneuve said the script was "almost finished" but also said he "[does not] want to rush it", citing Hollywoo's tendency of focusing on release dates over a fil's overall quality,  and adding, "I want to make sure that if we go back there a third time I want it to be good and I want it to be even better than Part Two ".  Villeneuve also considered waiting a few years for Chalamet to grow older, given that Dune Messiah is set 12 years after the events of the original book.  Ahead of Dune: Part Two' s release, Zimmer revealed he was already writing music for a third film after Villeneuve came in and "wordlessly" put a copy of Dune Messiah on his desk.  In April 2024, it was reported that Villeneuve and Legendary had officially begun development on the third film.   Villeneuve has said that Messiah would be his final Dune film.  Dune 3 is set to be released on December 18, 2026  See also [ edit ] List of films featuring eclipses List of films split into multiple parts

2024 film by Adam Wingard Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire  is a 2024 American monster film directed by Adam Wingard . Produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures , it is the sequel to Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) and the fifth film in the Monsterverse franchise, also serving as the 38th film of the Godzilla franchise and 13th in the King Kong franchise . The film stars Rebecca Hall , Brian Tyree Henry , Dan Stevens , Kaylee Hottle , Alex Ferns , and Fala Chen . Hall, Henry, and Hottle reprise their roles from the previous film. In the film, Kong encounters more of his species in the Hollow Earth and must unite again with Godzilla to stop the tyrannical Skar King and the powerful, frost-breathing Shimo from invading the Eart's surface. Following the box office and streaming success of Godzilla vs. Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic , Legendary announced a sequel in March 2022 and that filming would commence later that year. In May 2022, it was announced that Wingard would return to direct and Stevens had been cast as a lead. Filming began in July 2022 in the Gold Coast, Australia , and finished in November 2022. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire premiered at Grauma's Chinese Theatre on March 25, 2024, and was released in the United States on March 29. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many comparing it unfavorably to Godzilla Minus One . It grossed $570 million worldwide on a $135–150 million budget, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2024 , the highest-grossing film of the Monsterverse, as well as in the Godzilla and King Kong franchises. A sequel is set to be released on March 26, 2027. Plot [ edit ] Three years after defeating Mechagodzilla ,  Kong has established his new territory in the Hollow Earth and searches for more of his kind. On Eart's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as "Titans" — killing Titanus Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island , to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic . Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the trib's lair, and the two slowly bond on their journey. The trib's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. Shim's ice breath injures Kon's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suk's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age , and waged war against Godzill's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra . Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. Unknown to them, one of Skar Kin's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kon's attempts to communicate, an enraged Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro , and Shimo induces a second ice age at Skar Kin's command. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kon's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. After undoing Shim's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iw's home and the portals. Kong returns with Shimo and Suko to Hollow Earth, where he becomes the ape trib's new leader. Cast [ edit ] Rebecca Hall as Dr. Ilene Andrews, a scientist and anthropological linguist at Monarch Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie Hayes, a conspiracy theorist and former Apex employee Dan Stevens as Trapper, a veterinarian at Monarch Kaylee Hottle as Jia, last known survivor of the Iwi tribe and Ilen's adopted daughter Alex Ferns as Mikael, a pilot at Monarch Fala Chen as Iwi Queen Rachel House as Hampton Ron Smyck as Harris Chantelle Jamieson as Jayne Greg Hatton as Lewis Kevin Copeland as Submarine Commander Tess Dobré as Submarine Officer Tim Carroll as Wilcox Anthony Brandon Wong as Talk Show Announcer Allan Henry as Kong and Skar King ( performance capture )  Production [ edit ] Development [ edit ] In March 2019, producer Alex Garcia stated that Legendary Pictures hoped to produce more MonsterVerse films if they became successful, stating, "I's one brick at a time, each piece has to be as good as it can be, so right now i's all focused on this Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong . But could there be? Yeah, tha's the hope if the movies turn out really well."  In February 2021, Wingard commented on the future of the Monsterverse, "I know where we could go potentially with future films." However, he noted that the Monsterverse was created "to a certain degree" to lead towards Godzilla vs. Kong .  He added that the Monsterverse is at a "crossroads", stating, "I's really at the point where audiences have to kind of step forward and vote for more of these things. If this movie is a success obviously they will continue forward."  Godzilla vs. Kong was released on March 24, 2021, and became a box office and streaming hit during the COVID-19 pandemic .  The film grossed $470 million worldwide against a break-even point of $330 million,   and became the most pirated film of 2021.  On April 4, 2021, Legendar's CEO Josh Grode commented on potential sequels, "we have a number of ideas for more movies."  That same day, the hashtag #ContinueTheMonsterverse began trending on Twitter , which was acknowledged by Legendary and garnered support from Jordan Vogt-Roberts , director of Kong: Skull Island (2017).   On April 27, 2021, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Legendary was "quietly taking steps to stretch the series into one or more installments" while negotiating with Wingard to potentially return to direct. Various ideas were considered, with Son of Kong being one potential title.  In August 2021, Monsterverse writer Max Borenstein stated that "there will be some new, interesting installments coming" due to the success of Godzilla vs. Kong .  On March 20, 2022, it was announced that a sequel to Godzilla vs. Kong was scheduled to commence filming later in the year in the Gold Coast, Queensland , and other locations in South East Queensland .  In May 2022, it was announced that Wingard would return to direct and that Dan Stevens had been cast as a lead. Wingard and Stevens had previously worked together on The Guest (2014).  In May 2022, Production Weekly reported that the fil's working title was Origins .  On June 30, 2022, it was revealed that Mary Parent , Alex Garcia, Eric McLeod, Brian Rogers, Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni would return to produce.   On July 1, 2022, Toho confirmed that the film would feature Godzilla .  Pre-production [ edit ] Wingard recalled that preproduction on the film began in January 2022.  In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary announced a new synopsis and that Rebecca Hall , Brian Tyree Henry and Kaylee Hottle would reprise their roles from Godzilla vs Kong while Fala Chen , Alex Ferns and Rachel House would join the cast as well. It was also revealed that Wingard would collaborate once more with production designer Tom Hammock, editor Josh Schaeffer, composer Tom Holkenborg , and that Terry Rossio had returned to write the script with Jeremy Slater and Wingar's frequent collaborator Simon Barrett .   Ultimately, Rossio, Barrett, and Slater received "screenplay by" credit, while Rossio, Wingard, and Barrett received "story by" credit; Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields, both of whom co-wrote Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong , shared off-screen "additional literary material" credit with James Ashcroft, Eli Kent , and Nicole Perlman .   Filming [ edit ] Principal photography commenced in the Gold Coast, Queensland, on July 29, 2022.  At the start of production, Ben Seresin was confirmed to have returned as director of photography.  In November 2022, it was reported that filming had finished in Australia and that crew gear revealed the fil's potential title, at the time, as Godzilla and Kong .  Post-production [ edit ] The fil's visual effects were supervised by Alessandro Ongaro.  Wingard confirmed that Mothra's inclusion was always part of the plan. However, Legendary did not have the rights to Mothra by the time that post-production began and used a placeholder character named "Phosphera" until the rights were secured. Wingard also refuted rumors that Phosphera was replaced with Mothra due to poor testing, iterating that Mothra was included as far back as the first draft.  Influences [ edit ] After watching the trailer for Godzilla Minus One (2023), Wingard and Ongaro decided to pay tribute to that film by recreating a shot of the ground bursting beneath Godzill's footfall for the fil's Rome sequence.  The Egyptian battle between Godzilla and Kong was inspired by the fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David from They Live (1988).  Music [ edit ] In August 2022, Tom Holkenborg was announced to return to compose the fil's score, after previously doing so for Godzilla vs. Kong .  In December 2023, it was announced that Antonio Di Iorio would co-compose the score with Holkenborg.  A single was released on March 13, 2024, by WaterTower Music , titled “Main Title Theme.” The full soundtrack album was released on March 22, 2024.  For the Japanese release, artists Ai , Yaffle, and OZworld contributed to the track " Rise Together " as the fil's theme and was released on April 17, 2024.  Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire held its red carpet premiere at the Grauma's Chinese Theatre on March 25, 2024.  Afterward, it was released internationally on March 27 and in the United States on March 29,  and was released in Japan on April 26 via Toho.  It was previously slated to be released on March 15 and April 12.   Incidentally, Toh's Godzilla Minus One was withdrawn from U.S. theaters eight weeks before the release of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire .  Home media [ edit ] The film was released on digital platforms on May 14, 2024, and on Blu-ray , DVD and Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 11, 2024.  Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire became available to stream on Max on July 4, 2024.  Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has grossed $196.4 million in the United States and Canada and $373.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $569.7 million.  As of 2024, it holds the record for the highest-grossing Godzilla film ever.  In the United States and Canada, Godzilla x Kong was initially projected to gross $50–55 million from 3,850 theaters in its opening weekend and an additional $80–90 million from 63 international territories.  After making $37 million on its first day, including $10 million from Thursday previews, the best-ever total for a Monsterverse film, estimates were raised to $75 million over the domestic weekend. It went on to debut at $80 million, topping the box office and becoming the second-best opening weekend of the series and the fifth-best Easter weekend of all time, behind Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Furious 7 (2015), The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) and The Fate of the Furious (2017).  In its second weekend, the film made $31.2 million (a drop of 61%), remaining in first.  In its third weekend, the film made $15.5 million, finishing second behind newcomer Civil War .  Meanwhile, the film debuted at number two in Japan, behind Detective Conan: The Million-dollar Pentagram .  Critical response [ edit ] Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire received mixed reviews from critics.   On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 54% of 247 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The websit's consensus reads: "Come to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire for the sheer monster-mashing spectacle -- and stay for that too, because the movie does't have much else to offer."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 96% of audience members said the film "met or exceeded their expectations."  Several critics compared the film unfavorably to Toho's Godzilla Minus One .  Owen Gleiberman of Variety found Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire mediocre, likening it more to a superhero film , but felt that it was misfortunate that the film was released too soon after Godzilla Minus One , comparing that film with "lyrical majesty" and Godzilla x Kong more like a "product", but admitted that the film delivers on the monster battles, praising the Rome battle.  Pete Hammond from Deadline Hollywood likened the scenes with the Ape tribe to Planet of the Apes and noted that Godzilla, despite getting top billing and referenced repeatedly in the film, mostly plays a supporting role. He felt the human characters were the same "one dimensional caricatures" typically found in monster films, but admitted that they had a "nice rapport" regardless. Like Gleiberman, Hammond compared the film to Godzilla Minus One , calling it "far more impressive" than Godzilla x Kong and suggested that Legendary hire that fil's team next.  James Berardinelli also expressed dissatisfaction for the film and suggested that Godzilla Minus One writer-director Takashi Yamazaki make the next Monsterverse film.  The Sioux City Journal criticized the fil's visual effects as inferior to those in Godzilla Minus One .  Beyond the main cast, the humans in this movie exist only to get squashed like ants by falling debris and mangled buildings. They are expendable, but it does't matter. The meaning of these films is't in metaphor at all. I's in punching. —Alissa Wilkinson, The New York Times  The Guardian praised the choreography and cited Rebecca Hall's performance as "ever luminous", but felt that Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry struggled to convey the comedy they were entrusted with for their parts.  The fil's journey to the climax was a "mixed bag," wrote Empire , and its characters were "shallow but fun".  IndieWire attacked the CGI for being dull and not taking full advantage of its potential, suggesting that the filmmakers should have used Godzilla (2014) as a reference point to emphasize the gravitas of the monster scenes.  The Los Angeles Times described the film as a "roaring headache" but cited "two impressively goopy moments" in the beginning and the horror-like approach brought by the director "with a penchant for gleeful experimentation and over-the-top style".  Sequel [ edit ] Director Adam Wingard expressed interest in making a third film featuring both Godzilla and Kong , but noted that "it just depends on how Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire does and how things kind of shape out."  Wingard iterated that ideas have been discussed as to where to take the franchise onward and that he would take a "different approach" on the next film if h's invited back to direct.   He also suggested that the next film could potentially follow Godzilla primarily and explore his perspective in the same way that The New Empire followed Kong.  Commenting on the fil's box office success, producer and Legendar's chairman of worldwide production Mary Parent said, "This is certainly an exciting result. We are in a good position to continue the journey, but let’s see how Godzilla x Kong unfolds."  On May 10, 2024, Legendary announced that David Callaham , who wrote the early drafts for Godzilla (2014), will write a follow-up to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire .  The following week, Legendary announced that Wingard would not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts, but expressed interest in Wingard returning in the future.  In June 2024, Legendary announced Grant Sputore as the new director and that the film would be released on March 26, 2027.

2024 DreamWorks Animation film Kung Fu Panda 4 is a 2024 American animated martial arts comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures . It is the fourth installment in the Kung Fu Panda franchise and the sequel to Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016). The film was directed by Mike Mitchell , co-directed by Stephanie Ma Stine (in her feature directorial debut), written by Darren Lemke and the writing team of Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger , and produced by Rebecca Huntley. It features Jack Black , Ian McShane , Dustin Hoffman , James Hong , and Bryan Cranston reprising their roles from the previous films, with Awkwafina , Ke Huy Quan , Ronny Chieng , Lori Tan Chinn , and Viola Davis joining the cast as new characters. In the film, Po (Black), who must find and train his successor as the new Dragon Warrior, teams up with fox bandit Zhen (Awkwafina) to defeat evil sorceress The Chameleon (Davis), before she steals the kung-fu abilities of all masters in China. Directors Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni were asked about the possibility of a fourth Kung Fu Panda film before the release of the third film in January 2016, with Nelson later saying in August 2018 that she was open to a fourth installment. DreamWorks officially announced the fourth film in August 2022, with Mitchell, Ma Stine, and Huntley attached as director, co-director, and producer, respectively, by April 2023. Most of the main voice cast, along with the return of Aibel and Berger as writers and co-producers, was announced in December 2023, following Awkwafin's casting in May of that year. Lemk's involvement was confirmed in February 2024. Composer Hans Zimmer , who had scored for the previous three installments, the first two with John Powell and the third alone, returned as composer alongside frequent collaborator Steve Mazzaro. Some additional production assets were borrowed from Jellyfish Pictures . Kung Fu Panda 4 premiered at the AMC 14 Theater at The Grove in Los Angeles on March 3, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a box-office success, grossing over $545 million worldwide, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 2024 . Plot [ edit ] In the Valley of Peace, Po helps his fathers Li Shan and Mr. Ping open their new restaurant. Master Shifu then tells Po that he must advance and become a spiritual leader, which means Po can no longer be the Dragon Warrior and must find a suitable successor to take his place. Po struggles to choose the right candidate as he does not want to lose his status, and he stumbles upon a corsac fox bandit named Zhen trying to steal ancient weapons from the Jade Palace. Po is able to outsmart Zhen and send her to prison, but a group of mine workers tell him that Tai Lung has returned and destroyed an entire quarry. Zhen reveals that Tai Lun's return was masqueraded by a sorceress known as The Chameleon, who can shape-shift into any animal she wants as well as copying various kung fu skills simply by touching them. With Zhe's assistance, Po heads to Juniper City to take down The Chameleon, little knowing that his fathers, worried that Po won’t stand a chance against her, are following them. After encountering a shifty tavern and fighting off the inhabitants, they soon arrive at Juniper City and are almost arrested, but escape to the Den of Thieves, where they receive aid from the de's leader Han, who is also a close friend of Zhen. From there, Po and Zhen head to The Chameleo's lair until Po is captured. It is then revealed that Zhen has been acting as a double agent for The Chameleon, and was tasked to acquire P's Staff of Wisdom  , which has the power to access the Spirit Realm. Po almost manages to escape, but The Chameleon, taking Zhe's form, fools him and throws him off a cliff, to Zhe's horror. He nearly falls to his death, but is rescued by his fathers, who convince him that sometimes change can be good. Using the staff, The Chameleon summons every deceased kung fu master and steals their skills, including Lord Shen , General Kai , and Tai Lung . After escaping for good, Zhen reunites with Po, but he refuses to back down from facing The Chameleon, so she, Mr. Ping and Li head back to the Den of Thieves to convince them to help them save Po. As they battle The Chameleo's army of Komodo dragons , Po tries but fails to reason with The Chameleon, although she does give the staff back to him as she no longer needs it. They battle, but when Zhen intervenes, The Chameleon turns into a Chimera of several kung fu masters. After the battle, she then shifts into a copycat of Po, fights him, and soon traps him in a cage before reverting back to her original form. Putting his trust in Zhen, Po gives her the staff, with which she bests The Chameleon. Po, who was only pretending to be trapped, defeats The Chameleon using the staff and returns all of the stolen kung fu to their owners, who show respect to Po and return to the Spirit Realm, with Tai Lung taking The Chameleon with him. While returning to the Valley of Peace, Po chooses Zhen as his successor, much to Shif's annoyance. Confident with his choice, Po and the Furious Five help train Zhen to become the next Dragon Warrior. Voice cast [ edit ] Jack Black as Po , a giant panda who is set to become a spiritual leader after renouncing his title as the Dragon Warrior.  Black also voices The Chameleo's form of Po. Awkwafina as Zhen, a corsac fox who is a wanted thief and accompanies Po on his journey.  Awkwafina also voices The Chameleo's form of Zhen. Viola Davis as The Chameleon, a nefarious shape-shifting chameleon sorceress that can copy other' kung fu by absorbing their abilities and Zhe's boss.  Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu, a wise red panda and P's master.  James Hong as Mr. Ping, a Chinese goose and P's adoptive father.  Bryan Cranston as Li Shan, P's biological father.  Ian McShane as Tai Lung, a snow leopard who was Shif's adopted son and former disciple until he became evil. Po vanquished him to the Spirit Realm in the first film and General Kai captured him off-screen during the third film , but The Chameleon brings him back from the Spirit Realm. In this film, Tai Lung is the secondary antagonist after being the main antagonist of the 2008 film .  McShane also voices The Chameleo's form of Tai Lung. Ke Huy Quan as Han, a Sunda pangolin who is the leader of a den of thieves.  Lori Tan Chinn as Granny Boar, an elderly female boar who can take out her tusks and use them as weapons.  Ronny Chieng as Captain Fish, a green arowana that lives in a pelican's mouth, who is his seemingly adoptive mother. Harry Shum Jr. as Scott, a fire-breathing crocodile who was sent to the Spirit Realm by Po. The Furious Five make a brief non-speaking appearance in the end credits with the exception of Seth Rogen providing screams for Mantis. Lord Shen and General Kai also have non-speaking appearances when The Chameleon is summoning villains from the Spirit Realm. YouTuber Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson has a cameo as Panda Pig, a pig painted black-and-white who is one of the 5 candidates for the next Dragon Warrior.  Production [ edit ] Development [ edit ] On December 3, 2010, then- DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg said that there was a possibility the series could have three more sequels after Kung Fu Panda 3 , bringing it to a six-film series.  On January 13, 2016, Collider asked the filmmakers of Kung Fu Panda 3 about the possibility of a fourth film. Co-director Jennifer Yuh Nelson stated, "I's one at a time. We want to make this a perfect jewel, and then w'll see what happens after that". Co-director Alessandro Carloni said, "With the sequels, we do't want to try to have them feel open-ended. We want it to feel like a completed journey, and we feel this movie does. And then, if a fantastic story presents itself, great".  On August 2, 2018, when asked about the possibility of Kung Fu Panda 4 , Nelson replied that she always saw the series as a trilogy, but was open for a fourth installment as long as the franchise focused on Po .  In August 2022, DreamWorks Animation confirmed that Kung Fu Panda 4 was in production.  At CinemaCon in April 2023, more details for the film were revealed, such as the premise as described by Jack Black .  It was also announced that Mike Mitchell was set to direct the film, with Stephanie Ma Stine co-directing and Rebecca Huntley producing.  Mitchell was a creative consultant on the first film and an executive producer on the third film. The film was originally planned to be a live-action/animated hybrid, according to Ma Stine. Characters such as The Chameleon (known as The Collector) and Zhen would have been humans. This would all eventually be scrapped.  Writing [ edit ] By December 2023, it was reported that Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger returned to write the screenplay.  In February 2024, Darren Lemke was revealed to have co-written the screenplay.  Mitchell described Kung Fu Panda 4 as a love letter to the first film .   Despite its connections to previous entries in the series, he wanted the story to stand on its own.  When producing the third film, Mitchell felt that P's character development from the first film was wrapping up due to finally becoming the Dragon Warrior, so he wondered what if another sequel took "all that" away, leading the filmmakers to find some "really great heavy themes" that they felt are important for the modern world.  Additionally, Mitchell wanted to evolve P's character, introduce new characters, and expand the franchis's world,  feeling that the film took so long to be produced because the filmmakers wanted a perfect story that could evolve Po by making him learn something to advance to the next level.  He described Po as having a black-and-white view of the world and wanted to pair him with a more morally grey character, Zhen. Mitchell also wanted a character who Po can be frustrated by, like how Shifu gets frustrated by him.  For The Chameleon, Mitchell sought to make her a more-brain-than-brawn kind of villain.  He went on to say that she is the smartest and most supernatural foe Po has faced.   He described The Chameleon as a mirror to Po in that both characters were underestimated by society for their bodies, but went on to gain high status. He said, "So Po has become the greatest hero, and now sh's the greatest villain".  Mitchell felt that one of the things the Kung Fu Panda franchise stands out for, aside from Blac's Po, are its villains, so he made sure that The Chameleon could be as formidable as Tai Lung, Lord Shen and General Kai, hence his reasoning to specifically bring the former back into this seque's story.  Casting [ edit ] In May 2023, it was reported that Awkwafina had joined the voice cast of the film.  In December 2023, it was announced that Ke Huy Quan and Viola Davis would join the cast, with the latter playing the villain of the film, The Chameleon.   Lori Tan Chinn and Ronny Chieng were also announced as new cast members,  with Ian McShane , Bryan Cranston , James Hong , and Dustin Hoffman reprising their roles from the previous films.   Mitchell stated that he is a fan of McShan's work and that it was a "blast" to be able to work with him; had McShane refused to reprise his role as Tai Lung, there was no alternate plan for the fil's story, as filmmakers had "locked in" for Tai Lun's return.  In December 2023, Mitchell stated that Masters Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Mantis, and Viper—known collectively as the Furious Five—would make an appearance in the film and that they are "off on their own individual missions", with producer Rebecca Huntley confirming that there would be "a glimpse of the Furious Five".   In a March 2024 Discord Q&A session in a fan server, co-director Stephanie Ma Stine noted that the Furious Five were not originally going to appear despite protests from writers, artists, and animators. Ma Stine explained that it was due to the costs of the original actors, especially Angelina Jolie as Tigress. However, the marketing department told the filmmakers to include them in a cameo appearance.  She also expressed interest in having SungWon Cho be part of the film.  Animation and design [ edit ] Mitchell stated that the fil's fight scenes reflect advances in both technology and kung fu ,  and took more influence from anime than previous films in the series.  Stunt performers from Marvel films joined production to give the animators moves to study and use in the choreography.  The Chameleon was DreamWork' most complex character to animate, with a total of 8,130 controls.  While most of the animation for the film was provided by DreamWorks Animation Glendale, Jellyfish Pictures —who previously worked with DreamWorks on How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming , Spirit Untamed , The Boss Baby: Family Business , and The Bad Guys —handled the additional asset production services using proprietary software like Premo and Moonray. Kung Fu Panda 4 and The Wild Robot will be the last two films to be made entirely in-house at DreamWorks Animation, as Cartoon Brew reported on October 6, 2023, that the studio would be moving away from producing films in-house in their Glendale campus to rely more heavily on outside studios after 2024.  Music [ edit ] Main article: Kung Fu Panda 4 (soundtrack) In December 2023, Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro, the former of whom also composed for the first three films, were announced to compose the fil's score.  A cover of Britney Spears' " ...Baby One More Time " by Tenacious D is featured in the end credits. The album was released on March 8, 2024, simultaneously with the movi's release, by Back Lot Music . Marketing [ edit ] Po returned to the Mac's Thanksgiving Day Parade in November 2023 as promotion for the film.  The trailer for the film, featuring The White Stripes' " Seven Nation Army ", along with a poster, was released on December 13, 2023. The trailer was viewed over 142 million times in the first 24 hours across all social media , becoming the most-viewed trailer for a Universal animated film, surpassing Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie , Minions: The Rise of Gru , Sing 2 and DreamWork' own Puss in Boots: The Last Wish .  Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] Kung Fu Panda 4 premiered at the AMC 14 Theater at The Grove in Los Angeles on March 3, 2024, and was released in the United States on March 8,   with showtimes a day prior.  The film was shown at the Columbia University School of the Arts on March 1, 2024.  Home media [ edit ] Kung Fu Panda 4 was released on digital download on April 9, 2024, and on 4K , Blu-ray , and DVD on May 28, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment . A short film titled Dueling Dumplings was released alongside it.   As part of Universa's deal with Netflix , the film will stream on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, before moving to Netflix for the next ten, and returning to Peacock for the remaining four.   However, on June 6, 2024, it was announced that Kung Fu Panda 4 will be released on Peacock on June 21, 2024. Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] As of June 4, 2024  , Kung Fu Panda 4 has grossed $193.6 million in the United States and Canada and $351.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $545.4 million.   In the United States and Canada, Kung Fu Panda 4 was released alongside Imaginary and Cabrini , and was projected to gross $45–50 million from 3,900 theaters in its opening weekend.   The film made $19.4 million on its first day, including $3.8 million from Thursday night previews.   It went on to debut to $58 million, topping the box office and becoming the highest opening weekend for a DreamWorks Animation film since Madagascar 3: Europ's Most Wanted in 2012.   The film made $30.1 million in its second weekend (a drop of 48%), remaining in first.  It made $16.5 million in its third weekend, finishing in third behind newcomer Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and Dune: Part Two .  Kung Fu Panda 4 completed its domestic theatrical run on June 6, 2024.  Critical response [ edit ] The reception for Kung Fu Panda 4 was generally positive.  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 72% of 157 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The websit's consensus reads: " Kung Fu Panda 4 offers enough eye-catching entertainment to sustain the franchis's young fans, although i's starting to feel like this series is running out of steam."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale (the same as the first film ), while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score, with 59% saying they would recommend it.  Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "With its new settings and characters, including Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan as a pangolin leader of a den of thieves and Ronnie Chieng as a fish that lives in a pelica's mouth, Kung Fu Panda 4 clearly aims to refresh the franchise. But i's really more of the same, which is not such a bad thing when you consider that the series has grossed some $1.8 billion so far (and tha's not including the spin-off projects, including various television series and video games). Its appeal still lies largely in Blac's hilarious vocal performance which has lost none of its charm."  Wilson Chapman of IndieWire gave the film a B- and wrote, "Black can, at this point, play this role in his sleep, but he still gives it his all in his fourth go around, and his pitch perfect comic timing and lovable earnestness makes the journey an easy one to take."  For The New York Times , Claire Shaffer complimented the fil's art direction and Black and Awkwafin's chemistry; overall, she felt it "is an enjoyable Kung Fu Panda movie, even if i's missing some of the pizazz of the earlier ones."  Mentioning the relatively lower budget of this installment, a review in Le Devoir found that it allowed the film to focus more efficiently on'the essence of the art of cartoon (but by computer all the same), its Disneyesque characters, and the settings, still rich in depth and color, of the Valley of Peace, this fantastic reproduction of Ancient China'  Owen Gleiberman of Variety unfavorably compared the film to its predecessors, writing, "Even after 16 years of Po, you want to hear Jack Blac's voice charged with that youthful cockeyed exuberance, rather than the older-and-wiser aura he exudes here. You also wish the movie had better jokes. Mitchell, co-directing with Stephanie Stine, does't stage the action bouts with the surreal freedom that animation makes possible. Po goes through the motions, but 'm sorry, the kick is gone."  Similarly, The Boston Globe's Odie Henderson expressed disappointment with the fil's villain and action sequences, concluding "I enjoyed the first three adventures of the Dragon Warrior, but the best thing he can do now is to give this series a much needed skadoosh, sending it to rest in the cinematic spirit realm."  Christy Lemire , in her review for RogerEbert.com , wrote Kung Fu Panda 4 "struggles to justify its existence. It lacks both the delicate artistry and warm wit of its predecessors. The subtle sense of spirituality is long gone; in its place are frantic action sequences."  In a mixed review for the Los Angeles Times , Katie Walsh stated that'Though visually dazzling,'Kung Fu Panda ' shows a flabby franchise in need of punc'.  Mark Kermode gave the film a negative review.  Accolades [ edit ] The film is nominated for Favorite Animated Movie , Favorite Male Voice from an Animated Movie for Jack Black and Favorite Female Voice from an Animated Movie for Awkwafina at the 2024 Kid' Choice Awards .

2024 film directed by Adil & Bilall Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a 2024 American buddy cop action comedy film starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence . The fourth installment of the Bad Boys series of buddy cop films, and the sequel to Bad Boys for Life (2020), it was directed by Adil & Bilall and written by Chris Bremner and Will Beall . Joe Pantoliano , Vanessa Hudgens , Alexander Ludwig , Paola Núñez , Jacob Scipio , John Salley , and DJ Khaled reprise their roles from previous installments. Tasha Smith joins the cast as Theresa Burnett replacing Theresa Randle , who played the character in the last three films. The story follows Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, who are attempting to clear the name of their late Captain, Conrad Howard, after he is falsely accused of conspiracy. Bad Boys: Ride or Die premiered at Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai on May 22, 2024, and was released in the United States on June 7. The film grossed $361 million worldwide against a production budget of $100 million, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2024 . Plot [ edit ] Four years after the death of Isabel Aretas,  MPD Detective Mike Lowrey marries his physical therapist, Christine. During the ceremony, his partner, Detective Marcus Burnett, suffers a mild heart attack and goes into a coma, where he experiences a vision of the late Captain Conrad Howard telling him it is not his time. When Marcus wakes up, he believes he cannot die. Soon after, a news report reveals that Captain Howard was tied to corruption with the drug cartels. With Captain Howar's legacy being posthumously tarnished, Mike and Marcus are determined to prove his innocence with the help of Captain Rita Secada and her new boyfriend, mayoral candidate Adam Lockwood. Mike and Marcus visit Mik's son, Armando Aretas, who is incarcerated for Howar's murder. Armando tells them that Howard was not corrupt, but knows who is, so the corrupted officials hired him and his mother to kill Howard because he was close to exposing the corruption and offers to help them identify the person responsible for Howar's murder. When the conspirators try to access Captain Howar's computer, a fail-safe, pre-recorded video is sent to Mike and Marcus, warning them of corruption within federal and state law enforcement. Howard uses the phrase "Coke bottle" as a codephrase and it is revealed that he gave information to their former hacker colleague Fletcher. They go to Fletche's club to retrieve the "files", which turns out to be a QR code hidden in wall art that unlocks a second video from Captain Howard. However, assassins hired by the conspirators tail them to the club and kill Fletcher. Meanwhile, Armando is attacked by several of the conspirators disguised as prisoners, but he fends them all. Mike and Marcus arranged for Armando to be air-lifted to a more secure location in Miami. However, the conspirators sneak on board and kill the pilot and guards, causing the helicopter to crash. Mike, Marcus, and Armando survived but are branded as wanted fugitives by the conspirators. When the conspirators put out a bounty, the three are hunted by both law enforcement and opportunistic criminals. Conra's daughter, U.S. Marshal Judy Howard, swears vengeance on Armando for killing her father. With the assistance of AMMO, Mike, Marcus, and Armando, along with AMMO members Dorn and Kelly, uncover the video clues behind the murder and setup. Armando identifies the man who hired him to kill Captain Howard as James McGrath, a former Army Ranger turned DEA agent. While undercover, McGrath got captured by the cartel and was tortured until he gave up his associates and has been working with them ever since. McGrath orchestrates the kidnapping of Christine and Callie, Jud's daughter. He then sends his men to get Marcu' family, but his Marine son-in-law, Reggie, single-handedly kills them all. Rita, Dorn, and Kelly apprehend Lockwood after he is exposed to be working with McGrath. Using Lockwood as bait, the team engages in a fierce gunfight with McGrat's men at a former alligator-themed amusement park to rescue Christine and Callie, where Lockwood is devoured by an alligator after he attempts to double-cross the team. Mike confronts McGrath, who holds both Christine and Marcus hostage at gunpoint. McGrath then presents Mike with an ultimatum: he must pick either Christine or Marcus to die. Mike, alluding to Marcu' newfound belief that he "cannot die", shoots Marcus in his bulletproof vest. The chaos allows Christine and Marcus to break free before Mike shoots McGrath dead. Amidst the chaos, Judy finds Armando and prepares to kill him, but Callie appears and tells her mother that Armando saved her life. Begrudgingly grateful for his heroic act, Judy shows mercy to Armando and allows him to escape. After they and Howard are cleared of all charges and the corruption is exposed, Mike and Marcus celebrate by cooking food on a public grill with Reggie. Cast [ edit ] Will Smith as Det. Lt.

It was originally scheduled to be released on July 3, 2019,  but was moved up to May 24, 2019,  before being pulled from the schedule. In July 2023, it was announced that the film would be released on June 14, 2024.  In February 2024, the release date was moved up a week to June 7.   Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] As of July 8, 2024  , Bad Boys: Ride or Die has grossed $178.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $183.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $361.8 million,   becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2024 .  In the United States and Canada, Ride or Die was released alongside The Watchers , and was initially projected to gross around $40 million from 3,850 theaters in its opening weekend.  After making $21 million on its first day, including $5.88 million from Thursday night previews, weekend estimates were raised to $52 million. It went on to debut to $56.5 million, topping the box office.  72% of opening weekend tickets were sold day-of, while 50% of the audience was under 35, with 44% being Black, 26% Hispanic and Latino, 18% Caucasian, and 12% Asian American/other.  In its sophomore weekend the film made $33 million (an "amazing" drop of just 42%, the best of the series), finishing in second behind newcomer Inside Out 2 .  Critical response [ edit ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 64% of 231 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The websit's consensus reads: "Will Smith and Martin Lawrence remain good company even when Bad Boys strains to up the ante, proving ther's still life left in this high-octane franchise."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.  Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale, making the film the first installment in the series not to earn an A.  PostTrak reported a 90% overall positive score, with 84% saying they would definitely recommend it.  The BBC was more mixed, stating, "Critics are sometimes told that we should't analyse Hollywood blockbusters, we should just switch off our brains and enjoy them. Well, not many films are as dependent on our brains being on standby as Bad Boys: Ride or Die . The plot is nonsensical, the grenade-dodging stunts are even more nonsensical, and the internal logic is non-existent: the assertion that Marcus has to avoid stressful situations after his heart attack is forgotten within 30 seconds. But the film is fun enough in its chaotic, grungy, rough and ready way."  Possible sequel [ edit ] On June 7, 2024, Smith and Lawrence told Entertainment Weekly that they would be open to return for a fifth film in the franchise, as long as the younger cast members do more stunts and ther's a story involving their characters worth being told, with Lawrence also noting it would depend on whether the fans demanded more films.  On June 11, 2024, producer Jerry Bruckheimer noted that there had been discussions for a fifth Bad Boys film, but they are primarily waiting to see how Bad Boys: Ride or Die performs at the box office.

2024 American film by Wes Ball Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a 2024 American science fiction action film directed by Wes Ball and written by Josh Friedman . A standalone sequel to War for the Planet of the Apes (2017), it is the fourth installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot film series and the tenth film overall. It stars Owen Teague in the lead role alongside Freya Allan , Kevin Durand , Peter Macon , and William H. Macy . The film takes place 300 years after the events of War and follows a young chimpanzee named Noa, who embarks on a journey alongside a human woman named Mae to determine the future for apes and humans alike. Development on a new Planet of the Apes film began in April 2019, following Disne's acquisition of 20th Century Fox , with Ball attached as writer and director that December. Much of the script was written during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with casting commencing in June 2022, following the scrip's completion. Teague was cast in the lead role that August, with the fil's title and additional casting announced in the following months. Principal photography began in October 2022 in Sydney and wrapped in February 2023.   Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on May 2, 2024, and was released by 20th Century Studios in the United States on May 10. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and has grossed over $394 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2024 . Plot [ edit ] Many generations after Caesa's death,  apes have established numerous clans, while humans have become feral-esque. Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-like practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the gorilla general Sylva kills his father, Koro, before dropping Noa from a high platform. Left for dead, Noa awakens from the ashes, discovering that his clan has been abducted. He buries Koro and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesa's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylv's raiders suddenly attack them. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took No's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away  by the rapids. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the ape' settlement. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the ape' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Proximus believes that No's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and must retrieve a mysterious "book" capable of restoring speech to humanity inside. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the strong walls that surround the settlement. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae strangles him to death. The group enters the vault, finding a stockpile of weapons and Ma's "book", which is actually a satellite deciphering key. The apes discover childre's picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe. Lightning, one of Proximu' lieutenants, threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun and then triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Noa is pursued by Sylva but manages to trap and drown him. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. As No's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, explaining that she destroyed the bunker to prevent the apes from accessing its weapons. Noa questions whether apes and humans can co-exist peacefully given this disparity. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide. Cast [ edit ] Apes [ edit ] Owen Teague as Noa, a young chimpanzee hunter and the heir to his ape clan led by his father Koro Kevin Durand as Proximus Caesar, an ambitious and ruthless bonobo monarch who leads a coastal clan of apes in search of human technology and preaches an altered version of Caesa's teachings    Peter Macon as Raka, a wise and virtuous Bornean orangutan who becomes an ally of Noa   Lydia Peckham  as Soona, a young female chimpanzee and No's love interest  Travis Jeffery  as Anaya, a young male chimpanzee and No's best friend  Sara Wiseman  as Dar, No's chimpanzee mother Neil Sandilands  as Koro, No's chimpanzee father and the leader of the falconry ape clan  Eka Darville as Sylva, a western lowland gorilla and chief commander of Proximu' army   Ras-Samuel Weld 'abzgi  as Lightning, a chimpanzee soldier of Proximu' army Additionally, Karin Konoval and Terry Notary appear in the prologue as Maurice and Rocket, the Bornean orangutan and chimpanzee respectively from the previous films.  Humans [ edit ] Freya Allan as Mae,  a young woman who joins Noa on his journey while having her own agenda.  She is given the name "Nova" by Noa and Raka William H. Macy as Trevathan,  an opportunistic human who styles himself as Proximus Caesa's chief advisor and teaches him human history  Dichen Lachman  as Korina, a human leader of the human satellite base Production [ edit ] Pre-production and writing [ edit ] In October 2016, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) director Matt Reeves said that he had ideas for a fourth film in the Planet of the Apes reboot series .  In mid-2017, as War was released, Reeves and co-writer Mark Bomback expressed further interest in sequels. Reeves said that Steve Zahn's character, Bad Ape, established a primate world "much larger" than just Caesa's group of apes, adding that there are apes "who grew up without the benefit of Caesa's leadership" and suggesting that conflict would arise if Caesa's apes should encounter such outsiders.  Bomback felt that "there was probably only one more big chapter left to tell", explaining how Caesar "came to be this Moses figure in the Apes world". He suggested that other filmmakers might work on the sequel and that it could take place hundreds of years after War . Despite this, he clarified that there had not been conversations on a potential sequel, expressing his desire to "take a breather and let things rest a bit."  In April 2019, following the Walt Disney Company's acquisition of 20th Century Fox , Walt Disney Studios announced that further Planet of the Apes films were in development.  In August, it was confirmed that any future installments would be set in the same universe first established in Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011).  In December, it was announced that Wes Ball would write and direct the film,  after having previously worked with Reeves on a film adaptation of Mouse Guard . After that film was canceled by Disney following the merger, the studio approached Ball on developing a new Planet of the Apes film.  In February 2020, Ball confirmed that the film would not be a reboot, instead chronicling "Caesa's legacy".  Joe Hartwick Jr. and David Starke were also confirmed to serve as producers.  In April, it was announced that Peter Chernin , who produced the previous installments through Chernin Entertainment , would serve as executive producer. The film will be one of the compan's last films before it leaves 20th Century for Netflix .  The next month, it was revealed that Josh Friedman would co-write the script with Ball, and that Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would return to produce the film after doing so for the previous installments. Ball and Friedman would discuss the script through Zoom video calls, a routine which continued as the COVID-19 pandemic began. Instead of a direct sequel to War , Ball stated that the film would feel more like a follow-up to the previous films, and commented that the film could begin virtual production soon in spite of the pandemic due to the fact that much of the film contained computer-generated imagery (CGI).  In March 2022, 20th Century  president Steve Asbell stated that he was expecting a screenplay draft shortly, aiming for production to begin by the end of the year.  By June, Oddball Entertainment and Shinbone Productions were also set to produce the film,   while the search for the main star was underway following the scrip's completion the previous month.  The fil's title was revealed to be Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes in September 2022, with the film revealed to take place many years after the events of War . Jaffa, Silver, and Patrick Aison joined the writing team, with Ball no longer credited as screenwriter. Jason Reed and Jenno Topping were also announced as producer and executive producer, respectively, while Starke was no longer expected to serve as producer.  Ball stated the film was set during the "Dark Ages", where the apes rediscover lost items from the past in "this grand adventure"; Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes takes place 300 years following Caesa's death. He felt the protagonist Noa was neither a child nor adult, but a figure placed in "extraordinary" circumstances and living in a nomadic ape tribe. Teague also stated that Noa does't have a self-perception of identity but was inspired by Caesa's legacy and message of "apes together strong". He compared the antagonist, Proximus, to that of inventor Thomas Edison as he had rediscovered electricity , which was knowledge lost during the Dark Ages. Durand felt that the name Proximus Caesar was a self-proclaimed title, as his goal was to ensure the continued prosperity of apes despite subverting Caesa's original teachings.   He had the idea to change the timeframe after taking inspiration from the film Apocalypto (2006), as it had provided him an opportunity for a "whole new trajectory". Hartwick Jr. stated that the film was focusing on Noa exploring the world for the first time.  Ball intended for what Noa, Mae, and Soona saw through the telescope in the middle and end of the film would remain ambiguous, saying, "I figured there is nothing I could show you that would be stronger than what the audienc's imagination would conjure up...Sure, it might turn some people off, but some people will like it. I have ideas of what the're looking at...Space obviously is a key idea in all of these movies. So, maybe i's them looking to the future?"  Casting [ edit ] In August 2022, Owen Teague joined the cast of the film in the lead motion-capture role.  The next month, Freya Allan and Peter Macon joined the cast with the announcement of the fil's title and release year,  as did Eka Darville and Kevin Durand in October.   Travis Jeffery, Neil Sandilands , Sara Wiseman , Lydia Peckham and Ras-Samuel Weld 'abzgi were added to the cast later that month,  while William H. Macy and Dichen Lachman were cast in January and February 2023, respectively.   After being cast, Teague began to volunteer and study the animals at the Center for Great Apes in Florida. At first, he studied chimpanzees as a whole to see their typical day and examine how they move. However, he was drawn to a specific chimp, Bentley. It was Bentle's curious nature that made Teague resonate with him. Teague says it was Bentley that inspired how he developed the character of Noa as an actor.  Filming [ edit ] Principal photography began in October 2022 at Disney Studios Australia in Sydney, with funding partially provided by the Australian Government ,  under the working title Forbidden Zone . Filming concluded on February 15, 2023.  Ball added filming primarily occurred on location alongside using motion-capture technology.  Post-production and visual effects [ edit ] Erik Winquist served as the visual effects supervisor, with vendors including Wētā FX , which had previously done work on the prior three Planet of the Apes reboot films.  Ball stated the film did not use The Volume technology, which had previously been employed for The Mandalorian , focusing on filming on-location and using full CG. He went on to compare the fil's CG to that of James Cameron's Avatar franchise.  The team used techniques for their previous film Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) when working on an action sequence involving a human-hunt taking place on rivers. This was due to requiring the CG models of apes based on motion-capture performances to appear realistic when interacting with water.  Music [ edit ] John Paesano , who had previously collaborated with Ball on the Maze Runner film trilogy (2014–2018), composed the film score for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes . Paesano incorporated Jerry Goldsmith's original themes from the 1968 film within the score, describing it as "the musical legacy".  The soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on May 10, 2024.  Release [ edit ] Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes held its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on May 2, 2024,  followed by an early access screening on May 8.  It was released in the United States on May 10, 2024, in both conventional theaters and in IMAX , Dolby Cinema , 4DX , and ScreenX .  The film was previously set for release on May 24,  but was rescheduled two weeks earlier to avoid competition with Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and The Garfield Movie during Memorial Day weekend.  Marketing [ edit ] A teaser trailer was released on November 2, 2023.   Bryan Britt of Inverse compared the fil's premise to that of the original Planet of the Apes film from 1968.  A second trailer premiered during Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024.   As part of a viral marketing campaign in California, actors wearing realistic ape costumes were dispatched on horseback to Venice Beach and Crissy Field in April 2024.   This campaign extended to the New York City Metropolitan area as similar actors on horseback were seen at Liberty State Park with the Manhattan skyline and Statue of Liberty in the background.  Home media [ edit ] Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes was released on premium video on demand (PVOD) on July 9, 2024 by 20th Century Studios and on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray on August 27 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment .  The Blu-ray editions will also include Inside The Lens: The Raw Cut , a full-length alternative cut showing the hands-on process of making the film and the actor' raw motion-capture performances before visual effects were added.   Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] As of July 8, 2024  , Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has grossed $169.7 million in the United States and Canada and $225.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $394.8 million.   In the United States and Canada, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes was projected to gross $50–55 million from 4,075 theaters in its opening weekend.   The film made $22.2 million on its first day, including $6.6 million from preview screenings ($1.6 million on Wednesday and $5 million on Thursday).  It went on to debut to $58.4 million, topping the box office and marking the third-best opening weekend of the franchise behind Dawn of the Planet of the Apes ($72.6 million in 2014) and Planet of the Apes ($68.5 million in 2001).   In its second weekend, the film made $25.5 million (a drop of 56%), finishing second behind newcomer IF ,  and then came in fourth place the following weekend with $13.4 million.  Outside the U.S., Kingdom was projected to debut to $80–90 million.  It ended up making $72.7 million, for a worldwide opening of $129 million, with the largest markets being China ($11.4 million), France ($7.1 million), Mexico ($6.4 million), the United Kingdom ($4.8 million), South Korea ($3.2 million), Australia ($2.7 million), Brazil ($2.6 million), Germany ($2.2 million), and Spain ($2.2 million).  Critical response [ edit ] According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , critics described the film as having " Avatar -level visual effects", complemented by "standout performances and top-notch action", although "it does't quite meet the heights of its predecessors."  On the website, 80% of 306 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7/10. The sit's critics consensus reads: "Carving out a new era for The Planet of the Apes with lovable characters and rich visuals, Kingdom does't take the crown as best of the franchise but handily justifies its continued reign."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, down from the "A−" earned by the three previous films, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 77% overall positive score.   Writing for The New York Times , critic Alissa Wilkinson called the film "uncommonly thoughtful, even insightful".  Tyler Bur of The Washington Post praised the fil's visuals, describing the computer generated primates as “breathtakingly hyper-real”. However, Bur criticized the human characters as “two-dimensional”, including Mae, who he viewed as a “plot device more than a human being”.  Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent called the film "traditional and robustly crafted, in a way that’s deferential less to the trends of today than to some half-remembered dream of Hollywood’s classical epics."  Charles Pulliam-Moore of The Verge disliked the tendency of the plot to lay the ground for "sequels down the line  than to really dig into the substance at hand".  Jake Wilson of The Age gave it 2/5 stars, writing, "Plainly, this is not a movie to be taken too seriously, but at nearly two-and-a-half hours, it’s also much too slow and ponderous to qualify as a campy good time."  A review for the BBC criticized the fact that the film repeats various elements of the precedent instalment, stating, "If you have seen War for the Planet of the Apes (2017), the final instalment of the Caesar trilogy, you might be astonished at how derivative the last stretch of Kingdom is. Once again, a ruthless leader holds apes prisoner in an abandoned weapons depot. This time everything is rusted from age and the ruler is Proximus instead of Woody Harrelso's Colonel, but still."  Accolades [ edit ] Future [ edit ] In June 2022, it was reported that Disney and 20th Century planned for Kingdom to be the first of a new trilogy of Planet of the Apes films.  Wes Ball confirmed this in December 2023, explaining that the film had been conceived as the beginning of a trilogy that "fit into the legacy of" the previous three films.  Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver also expressed interest in making a third trilogy of films, thus bringing the total of the Planet of the Apes reboot films to nine films.

Plot [ edit ] Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Felonious Gru attends a reunion at his school Lycée Pas Bon where he reunites with his rival Maxime Le Mal, who has a feud with Gru for stealing his talent show act when they were younger. Maxime reveals he has enhanced himself with cockroach parts to make himself overpowered and so he can conquer the world, but Gru has him arrested with the help of the AVL. Maxime escapes prison and reveals his invention that turns people into human-roach hybrids, which he plans to use specifically on Gr's biological infant son Felonious Gru Jr. Silas Ramsbottom visits the Gru household to inform them of Maxim's escape, and the AVL will have to relocate the Gru family to a house in another town under new identities. Most of the Minions are taken in by the AVL, where Silas selects five of them—Dave, Mel, Gus, Tim and Jerry—to be augmented with powers under an initiative called the Megaminions, but the initiative is called off after the group causes damage in a city. In their new well-off residential town, Gru and his family meet their neighbors the Prescotts and their daughter Poppy.

Gru meets up with Maxime at a building where he reveals he has transformed Gru Jr. into a roach hybrid and fights him off with Gru Jr. Gr's encouraging words to his son manage to break Gru Jr. free from his state and attack Maxime instead. Maxime falls to the ground where he is further squashed by the Megaminions and the aid of many animals and insects, who arrive in turn to arrest him. Gru and his family return to their home, where Dr. Nefario reverses Gru Jr's transformation. Gru later visits Maxime in prison to talk and settle their differences.

Production [ edit ] Development of Despicable Me 4 began in September 2017, with longtime Despicable Me and Illumination writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio writing early drafts of the script.  The film was officially confirmed in February 2022, with veteran Despicable Me director Chris Renaud , Patrick Delage, and Mike White attached as director, co-director, and writer, respectively, and a July 3, 2024, release date announced.

Fred McDade, who had not appeared since the first film was recreated from scratch as his character model was too old. The sequence where Poppy plays with an arcade machine originally started out as an animation test for the character but the filmmakers liked the sequence it was added to the final cut of the film.  Music [ edit ] In March 2024, Heitor Pereira was announced to be composing the fil's score, returning from the previous installments.  Pharrell Williams was also confirmed to be returning to co-compose the score with Pereira as well as to write new songs.

On June 14, 2024, Williams released the song as the first single from the Despicable Me 4 soundtrack.  The song has been interpreted as a diss track aimed at Canadian rapper Drake .   Writing for Uproxx , Derrick Rossignol observed that "the tune isn’t as general and movie-agnostic as something like " Happy ," but it has a great groove, and that Gru refrain is actually catchy as hell. This probably won’t be a world-changing single like "Happy," but i's in the upper tier of kids movie soundtrack fare."  The original soundtrack was released on June 27, 2024, by Back Lot Music.  Marketing [ edit ] The first trailer for the film was released on January 28, 2024, during the 2023–24 NFL playoff championship games.  The trailer features the songs " Sweet Child ' Mine " by Guns ' Roses and " Maneater " by Hall & Oates , as well as in television showings, " Through the Fire and Flames " by DragonForce . CBR reported that the trailer showcased "the struggles of welcoming in a new member of the Gru family" and included the debut of Will Ferrel's Maxime Le Mal.  Screen Rant' s Brennan Klein observed that Gr's tumultuous relationship with his son, Gru Jr., contrasted with the good relationship with his adopted daughters.  An additional trailer was revealed on February 11 during Super Bowl LVIII , being narrated by Jon Hamm , who previously voiced Herb Overkill in the 2015 spin-off film Minions , and featuring cameos by Ferrell and Steve Carell. Ryan Gajewski of The Hollywood Reporter said the trailer appeared to "tout the benefits of modern technology but feature strange images supposedly generated by AI ," enjoying the Renaissance -era-inspired poses of Ferrell and Carell in the trailer.  On April 10, at CinemaCon , Universal displayed a clip of Gru and Poppy trying to steal a honey badger .  Brennan Kline of Screen Rant appreciated that the clip solidified the "important element" of Gr's domestic family man status in the sequel.  The second trailer was released on May 7, 2024.  Writing for TheWrap , Drew Taylor called the trailer "Minions-heavy" and pointed out one of Pharrell William' new original songs featured in the trailer.  Collider noted the "devastating consequences" of enlisting a small group of Minion volunteers for an experiment that gave them superpowers . Journalist Diego Peralta pointed out a sequence in which one of the super-powered minions destroys a part of their base with laser vision and said that villains Maxime and Valentina "are more dangerous than any threat Gru has faced before."  On June 8, 2024, Illumination released a parody teaser for the film in which Steve Carell announces the Megaverse , a parody of shared universes such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe , by claiming that Illumination would release 100 year' worth of films, television series, and stage productions starring the Mega Minions.  Illumination also published a website for the Megaverse .  Some of the fake productions noted on the website include Mega Minions: The Tax Write-Off and an untitled Mega Minions spin-off series with a "story to be determined based on rigorous market testing and ad hoc decision-making."  [ non-primary source needed ] The stunt was praised [ by whom? ] for its lampooning of current Hollywood affairs such as the cancellation of Warner Bros. films like Batgirl , Scoob! Holiday Haunt and Coyote vs. Acme and the 2022 DCEU film Black Adam , as well as the mixed reception to Disney's live-action remakes of their classic animated films and many of Marve's recent productions, such as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Secret Invasion .  [ failed verification ] Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] Despicable Me 4 premiered at the Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City on June 9, 2024,  and made its French premiere at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 13.  The film was theatrically released in Australia on June 20,  and in the United States on July 3.  Home media [ edit ] As part of Universa's long-term deal with Netflix , the film will stream on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, before moving to Netflix for the next ten and returning to Peacock for the remaining four.

In the United States and Canada, Despicable Me 4 was projected to gross $100–125 million from 4,030 theaters in its five-day opening weekend.   The film made $27 million on its first day and $26.8 million on its second.

Critical response [ edit ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 52% of 117 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The websit's consensus reads: "Fast paced and teeming with slapstick gags, Despicable Me 4 is as overstuffed as a piñata but full of enough candy to give audiences an enjoyable sugar rush."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 50 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale (same as the first two films), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave the film an 82% positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.  Variety admitted the film is entertaining but found the plot overcrowded with useless characters: "One thing is absolutely certain: We have't seen the last of these characters, even if we might prefer that a few of them sit out the next sequel—like the Mega Minions, who are't nearly as cute as they sound."  A similar appraisal can be found in Screen Rant  or in The Hollywood Reporter , noting, for example, the underdeveloped role of the villain in the midst of the various plot lines: "Running a brisk 95 minutes, Despicable Me 4 does't leave enough time for Maxime to enact his plans in a way that packs an emotional punch."  ABC News commented: "Should a review of a'Despicable M' movie be a thoughtful analysis or just a list of the funny stuff the Minions do in it? As much as I might believe in the value of film criticism, I kind of suspect that even the finest points of assessment would be dismantled about as fast as a Minion can say'Bello!' "

2024 film by Gil Kenan Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is a 2024 American supernatural comedy film directed by Gil Kenan from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jason Reitman . It is the sequel to Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), the fourth mainline installment, and the fifth film overall in the Ghostbusters franchise . The film stars Paul Rudd , Carrie Coon , Finn Wolfhard , Mckenna Grace , Celeste 'Connor , and Logan Kim reprising their roles from Afterlife , alongside Bill Murray , Dan Aykroyd , Ernie Hudson , Annie Potts , and William Atherton reprising their characters from the earlier films. Kumail Nanjiani , Patton Oswalt , Emily Alyn Lind , and James Acaster also join the cast. Set three years after the events of Afterlife , the veteran Ghostbusters must join forces with their recruits to save the world from a death-chilling god in New York City who seeks to build a spectral army.  Following the success of Afterlife , Sony Pictures announced the sequel in April 2022, with Reitman returning as director. Co-writer and executive producer Kenan later took over as director that December, with Reitman staying on as a co-writer and co-producer. That same month, Rudd, Coon, Grace, Wolfhard, 'Connor, Kim, Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson, Potts and Atherton were all confirmed to reprise their roles. New cast members including Nanjiani, Oswalt, Lind, and Acaster were announced in March 2023, with principal photography commencing that month and wrapping in June. Dario Marianelli was hired to compose the fil's score, replacing Afterlife composer Rob Simonsen . This is the first film in the Ghostbusters franchise to be released following the death of the franchis's co-creator and Jason Reitma's father Ivan Reitman , who posthumously receives credit as a producer alongside his son and Jason Blumenfeld. The film is dedicated to Reitma's memory and celebrates the 40th anniversary of the first film .  Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire had its world premiere at the AMC 13 Theater at Lincoln Square in New York City on March 14, 2024,  and was released in the United States on March 22, by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label.  The film received mixed reviews from critics, but generally positive feedback from audiences,  and has grossed over $201 million worldwide. Plot [ edit ] Three years after the events in Summerville, Oklahoma,  Callie Spengler, her boyfriend Gary Grooberson, her children Trevor and Phoebe, and their close friends Lucky Domingo and Podcast, relocate to New York City to aid Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz in reestablishing the Ghostbusters. After the group captures a ghost from Hel's Kitchen in Lower Manhattan , Walter Peck , the Ghostbuster' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor. To appease Peck, Callie removes underage Phoebe from the team. Upset, the teen attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, a teenage gir's ghost who died in a fire. Meanwhile, Ray and Podcast are collecting cursed objects for examination. Nadeem Razmaadi visits and sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings written in Mesopotamian Arabic inherited from his grandmother. Ray suspects it is an apotropaic trap due to copper alloys typically being used in rituals against the supernatural since the Bronze Age . When Ray evaluates its PKE levels, the orb immediately emits broad-spectrum psionic energy. A cold wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbuster' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is almost at capacity. Winston takes the orb to his privately owned paranormal research center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield. Using an experimental extraction device, he is unable to extract any spiritual energy from it. The or's captive psychically sabotages one of the cente's ecto-confinements, allowing a ghost to escape and hide in Podcas's equipment. To learn more, Lars joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals that the orb was kept hidden by his grandmother within a brass-lined chamber. Peter Venkman , brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinetic powers . Meanwhile Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian. Wartzki explains the orb was built over 4,000 years ago in Southwest Asia by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army who would use "Kusharit Umoti" – "the power to kill by fear itself." Nadee's grandmother belonged to the lineage of Firemasters, one of whom prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurer' Society, whom he froze to death. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to brass. This, combined with fire, and the removal of his horns trapped him within the orb. When the trio attempts to stop the escaped ghost from stealing a phonographic recording of the clu's ritual, Peck exploits Phoeb's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winsto's research center. She uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so the pair can physically interact. Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife. By controlling Phoeb's disembodied spirit, Garraka forces her physical body to recite the ritual chant. He then escapes, locates his horns, and begins freezing the city. Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit after freeing ones from the center, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters. They are aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers. Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. Phoebe electroplates Egon Spengler's proton pack with brass to strengthen it; Melody, betrayed by Garraka, atones by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka. Ray, with help from his fellow veteran Ghostbusters captures Garraka by improvising the ruptured containment unit as a giant trap. Melody reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes again, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. The Ghostbusters begin pursuing escaped ghosts across New York City. In a mid-credits scene , a trucker gets out of his Stay-Puft Marshmallows branded truck to make a purchase from a vending machine, while the Mini-Pufts steal his vehicle in his absence.

According to Nanjiani, the filmmakers drew inspiration from the animated series The Real Ghostbusters (1986–1991), noting they "wanted to make a long episode of the animated series".

Critical response [ edit ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 42% of 291 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The websit's consensus reads: " Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire offers a certain amount of nostalgia-fueled fun for fans of the original, but a crowded cast and surprisingly serious tone prevent this sequel from truly sparking."

Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.  Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would recommend the film.  Jake Wilson of The Age gave it 2.5/5 stars, writing: "Aykroyd and Grace are the soul of the thing, to whatever degree a soul exists. At this point, Aykroyd has shed any pretense of ironic distance, emerging as the mournful weirdo he surely always was."  CNN's Brian Lowry called it "a very busy movie that lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor while spending too much time on the wrong characters in a way that yields a rather lifeless, chilly affair."  Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, writing that it "carries the same endearingly goofy, science-nerd spirit of the first film and delivers a delightful balance of slimy ghost stuff, sharp one-liners, terrific VFX and a steady stream of callbacks to various characters, human and otherwise, from the 1984 movie."  Jake Coyle of the Associated Press gave it 2.5/4 stars, saying that it was "A significant upgrade from Afterlife " and "a breezier, more serviceable sequel that has a modest charm as an'80-tinged family adventure."  Accolades [ edit ] Future [ edit ] In February 2024, Kenan revealed that ideas for multiple future films in the Ghostbusters franchise had been discussed.   Kenan specifically mentioned the Mini-Pufts storyline as something he and Reitman would like to expand upon. The Mini-Pufts are featured in the fil's post-credits scene.

Plot [ edit ] Twelve-year-old Bea moves into her grandmother Margare's apartment in New York while her father waits for heart surgery in the same hospital where her mother died of cancer years earlier. One night, Bea sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmothe's building. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. She awakens in Ca's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends , nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing ride in Coney Island . Lewis, an elderly teddy bear and the head of the facility, inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital, but he is unable to see any of them. Lewis suggests to Bea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. Talking with her grandmother, she sees a picture of her as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background of the picture. Realizing Blossom was her grandmothe's IF, Bea decides to test Lewi' idea. Playing one of her grandmothe's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope. Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blu's original kid, Jeremy, now a grown man trying to launch a business. With help from Bea, Jeremy remembers Blue who gives Jeremy the confidence he needs for a business presentation. That evening, Bea arrives at Margare's who frantically informs her granddaughter that there has been a complication with her fathe's treatment. Comforted by Cal, Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, so Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. At the hospital, Bea tells her father a story about how she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she is just a child who still needs her father. He wakes up and they hug each other. When Bea goes outside his hospital room, she sees that all of the IFs, who accompanied her to the hospital, are gone. Returning to her grandmothe's building, Bea goes to thank Cal but discovers that the door to his apartment actually opens into an old storage room. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. During this, Bea realizes from an old picture she painted that Cal is actually her own IF, Calvin, forgotten after the death of her mother. She rushes to his room and thanks him for helping her and tells him she will always need him. This allows Bea to see Cal and the IFs again, and they reunite. Some time later, Cal begins reuniting the IFs with their original kids, now grown up. Benjamin meets his IF, a cartoonish dragon with glasses and a cast.

Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] IF was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on May 17, 2024,  after its originally scheduled release date of November 17, 2023 was first pushed to May 24, 2024, and then shifted forward by one week.  Home media [ edit ] The film was released on digital platforms by Paramount Home Entertainment on June 18, 2024.  It began streaming on Paramount+ beginning July 9, 2024,  and is set to be released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13, 2024.  Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] As of July 7, 2024  , IF has grossed $110.8 million in the United States and Canada and $74.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $185.5 million.   Variety estimated the film would need to gross $275 million worldwide in order to break-even.  In the United States and Canada, IF was  released alongside The Strangers: Chapter 1 and Back to Black , and was originally projected to gross around $40 million from 4,041 theaters in its opening weekend.  After making $10.3 million on its first day (including $1.8 million from Thursday night previews), weekend estimates were lowered to $30 million. It went on to debut to $33.7 million, topping the box office.

In France, the film made $3.3 million during its opening weekend in 621 cinemas.  Critical response [ edit ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 49% of 194 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The websit's consensus reads: "A sweet ode to rediscovering on's inner child, IF largely works as old-fashioned family entertainment despite an occasionally unfocused and unnecessarily complicated plot."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 84% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would definitely recommend it.  Adrian Horton of The Guardian awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing that it "checks the boxes" on the elements of a family-friendly movie, but also noting that it does not "fully conjure the magic" of other films in the genre.  Another mixed review was published on NPR by Bob Mondello , who wrote that "mostly the filmmakers detour, decorate and digitize their story rather than telling it, and that does't mesh well with the real-world stuff — da's surgery, for instance, and Be's wandering all over Brooklyn without her grandma seeming to notice. And yes, I know: IF is a kid-flick, but it still needs grounding. W're in Brooklyn, not Willy Wonkaland."  RogerEbert.com reviewer Clint Worthington called the film "a well-intentioned misfire".  Tomris Laffly of Variety wrote that the movie was "in desperate need of some coherent world-building", while praising the performance of Cailey Fleming in the lead role.  In a more negative review for The Hollywood Reporter , Frank Scheck criticised the film as "plagued by significant tonal shifts and pacing issues".  Noah Berlatsky of Chicago Reader was even more dismissive, stating, " IF makes you wish you were watching some other movie. (...) Ther's a fine line between the whimsical dream logic of Roald Dahl and irritating, incoherent nonsense. Director John Krasinsk's new kids film IF is nowhere near that line. Despite the best efforts of the extremely talented child actor Cailey Fleming, IF makes no sense, narratively, emotionally, or visually."  Several critics noted the fil's sharing some similarities with the Cartoon Network animated series Foste's Home for Imaginary Friends , which itself featured an orphanage that takes care of imaginary friends after their kids outgrow them and they leave after other children adopt them.

2024 film by Reinaldo Marcus Green Bob Marley: One Love is a 2024 American biographical drama musical film based on the life of reggae singer and songwriter Bob Marley , played by Kingsley Ben-Adir , from his rise to fame in the mid-1970s up until his death in 1981. The film is directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green , who co-wrote the screenplay with Terence Winter , Frank E. Flowers , and Zach Baylin .

It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $179 million worldwide. Plot [ edit ] In 1976, amidst armed political conflict that is affecting daily life in Jamaica, Bob Marley announces he will perform at a concert, Smile Jamaica , promoting peace amongst the warring factions. While preparing for the concert, Marley, his wife Rita , and several other members of his band are shot by assailants . Rita and Marley are hospitalized, but survive and recover from their injuries in time for the concert. After performing, Marley, saddened that his own countrymen would try to kill him and his wife, shows the crowd his bullet wounds before walking off stage. He tells Rita to take their children to Delaware in the United States and stay with his mom, as he and the rest of his band venture to London. After struggling to come up with a new album concept, Marley asks Rita to rejoin him and the band in England, and taking inspiration from the soundtrack of the film Exodus and their own situation, he and the band begin recording what would become their album of the same name . The album becomes a hit and helps further popularize reggae music and the Rastafari movement around the world. When the recording company schedules a tour in Europe, Marley also aims for stops throughout Africa to inspire the people there. This leads to friction with Rita as she and Marley argue about his responsibilities and both his and Rit's infidelities, in addition to having given up on promoting peace back in Jamaica. Marley also gets into an altercation with manager Don Taylor over a financial dispute. After a toenail infection raises concern from Rita and his record producer Chris Blackwell , Marley is later diagnosed with a rare skin cancer . Blackwell confronts Marley about treatment choices, reluctantly dismissed by a firm Marley. Faced with his own mortality, Marley reconciles with Rita and Taylor and finally decides to return to Jamaica in 1978, where he is welcomed back by a crowd at the airport. Back home, the gunman who had shot him and the others arrives and begs for forgiveness, to which Marley states he "keeps no vengeance". After Marley debuts a song to Rita and the children about reconciliation, she finally deems him ready to perform a peace concert. The film ends as Marley and his band gear up to perform again for the Jamaican crowd with the song " One Love ". A pre-credits montage shows clips of the real Marley and his band during the One Love Peace Concert , which sees them joined on-stage by the heads of both of Jamaic's political parties, also revealing that Marley and his band were able to perform  in Zimbabwe to celebrate the natio's independence before he died of his cancer in 1981 at the age of 36.

Critical response [ edit ] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 44% of 185 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The websit's consensus reads: "Kingsley Ben-Adir does an admirable job in the central role, but Bob Marley: One Love is ultimately a standard biopic that does't do justice to its brilliant subject."  Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 43 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.  Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 91% positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend the film.   Lovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "[Ben-Adir] wholly conjures Marle's charisma while also teasing the musicia's sense of isolation, stemming from a childhood marked by abandonment. His compelling performance enlivens a film that otherwise feels like i's perpetually struggling to take off."  Javier Ocaña of El País called the film "a serviceable biopic that is saved by its soundtrack"  while Expresso thought it "showed the man beyond the myth".  Brian Lowry of CNN called the film "a dutiful addition to a recent wave of such biographies (see Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody ), but a largely uninspired one."  The Age's Jake Wilson gave it 1.5/5 stars, calling it a "routine biopic" and writing, "considering this is unlikely to be the last attempt to dramatise Marle's life story, next time it would't hurt if a Jamaican filmmaker had a go."  The Atlantic's Hannah Giorgis wrote, " One Love might offer a less daunting entry point than Marley , which can feel intimidating in its scope. But his music and ideas—and all the people who helped usher them into this fractured world—deserve better."

The film was theatrically released on 22 February 2024 in Kerala and Tamil Nadu , and received critical acclaim.  It became the first film in the Malayalam film industry to earn more than ₹200 crore, and set several box-office records, becoming the the highest grossing Malayalam film ever , surpassing the record set by 2018 .  It also emerged as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of 2024 . Plot [ edit ] In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu , during the Onam vacation. They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves , a place where the film Gunaa was shot. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide . Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name "Manjummel Boys" on the rocks within the cave. After etching it on the wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picture and they all regroup. Subhash, one of the friends, falls into a covered hole in the ground while moving towards them. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard . The locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devi's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints and no help is offered. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. On the way, he informs them that the last person who fell into the hole was the former Central Ministe's nephew around ten years ago and all the forces had gotten together to rescue him, but no one had been able to. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. But soon one of the boys, Sixen hears Subhas's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. The fire department and more police officers are also called into the scene.They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels , and they are not willing to risk Kuttan’s life as well. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhas's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. The police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhas's family that he fell in a waterfall. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. 2 years later Kuttan is awarded the Jeevan Raksha Padak for his actions.

S. of The Times of India gave 4/5 stars and wrote " Manjummel Boys is't your average friendship flick packed like a survival film. If you are looking for a crisp survival film, this is it. I's an absolute marvel of visuals, absolutely good writing, characterisation, editing, acting and all the thrills".  Arjun Menon of Rediff gave 4/5 stars and wrote "Manjummel Boys gets so many things right that the small nitpicks do't amount to much in the larger picture".  Sanjith Sridharan of OTTplay gave 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 / 5 stars and wrote "Chidambaram has't tried to overdramatise Manjummel Boys for the sake of entertainment and has kept it mostly true to the events that had transpired in Kodaikanal in 2006".  Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Despite its shortcomings, Chidambara's film can indeed be seen as a powerful tribute to the real Manjummel Boys and their determined efforts to save their dear one".  Janani K. of India Today gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Director Chidambara's Manjummel Boys is a heartwarming thriller which is earnest in its attempt".  S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote "Though the survival thriller part brings back memories of Bharatha's Malootty , this one takes a different path by tying the events closely to their friendship of the characters".  Princy Alexander of Onmanorama wrote "Overall, the movie is a neatly crafted tale of friendship that triumphs over the survival drama".  The real life Manjummel Boys make a cameo appearance as the opposing gang during a tug of war contest.

2024 film directed by Blessy Aadujeevitham or The Goat Life is a 2024 Malayalam -language survival drama film written, directed, and co-produced by Blessy . The film is an international co-production involving companies in India and the United States. It is an adaptation of the 2008 best-selling Malayalam novel Aadujeevitham by Benyamin , which is based on the real-life story of Najeeb, a Malayali immigrant laborer, one among thousands of Indians who were forced into slavery in Saudi Arabia as goatherds on secluded farms in the deserts by the native Arabs .

The following year, he bought the rights from Benyamin and began writing the screenplay. However, due to budget constraints which prevented substantial progress, the film went into development hell . Blessy spent years searching for a producer, finally finding one in 2015, allowing the project to gain momentum. Jimmy Jean-Louis and Steven Adams joined Blessy as co-producers. A. R. Rahman composed the fil's original score and songs. Principal photography took place in phases between March 2018 and July 2022 through six schedules in the deserts of Wadi Rum , Jordan and the Algerian desert in the Sahara with some scenes shot in Kerala , India. The crew was stranded in Jordan for 70 days from March to May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic's restrictions. They were eventually repatriated to India via the Indian government's evacuation programme, Vande Bharat Mission . Filming concluded on 14 July 2022. The film was released worldwide on 28 March 2024 and grossed over ₹ 160 crore (US$19 million) till date.

Plot In Saudi Arabia , Najeeb Muhammed and Hakim, two Malayali immigrants, arrive seeking a better life with visas arranged by their acquaintance Sreekumar. Stranded at the airport without knowing their employer, they are approached by a local Arab who mistakenly assumes he is their boss. Following a long journey, they are separated, with Najeeb left to work in a remote desert goat herd. Enduring harsh conditions and isolation, Najeeb witnesses the demise of a fellow goatherd , realizing the peril of his own situation. After years of suffering, he is reunited with Hakim, who introduces him to Ibrahim Khadiri, a Somalian goatherd with knowledge of escape routes. They seize an opportunity during the Khafee's daughte's wedding, fleeing into the desert. Their journey turns perilous as they struggle to find sustenance and direction, resulting in Haki's death and Najee's near demise. Eventually, Khadiri also disappears. Alone in the desert, Najeeb eventually reaches civilization with the help of a passing Arab, and finds a local Malayali restaurant owned by Kunjikka, who nurses him back to health. However, Najee's troubles are far from over. He faces imprisonment due to his own documentation issues where he meets the Khafeel, who leaves him as he is not his official sponsor and cannot take him back. Despite this setback, Najeeb eventually returns home. Cast Prithviraj Sukumaran as Najeeb Muhammed K. R. Gokul as Hakeem Amala Paul as Sainu, Najee's wife Jimmy Jean-Louis as Ibrahim Khadiri Shobha Mohan as Ummah, Najee's mother Talib Al Balushi as Kafeel Rik Aby as Jasser Nasar Karutheni as Kunjikka Robin Das as Hindiwala Baburaj Thiruvalla as Karuvatta Sreekumar Akef Najem as Rich Man in Rolls Royce Production Development In 2010, it was reported that Blessy had embarked upon the adaptation of Benyamin's 2008 Malayalam novel Aadujeevitham for a feature film. In April 2010, he told to The Hindu that he was working on the screenplay and the film would be made on a wider canvas . He also confirmed that Prithviraj Sukumaran had been cast in the lead role.  Blessy had been contemplating the adaptation of a literary work for cinema ever since he had a discourse with journalist and writer V. K. Ravi Varma Thampuran about the waning tradition of adapting literary works, which was popular in Malayalam cinema during the 1970s and 1980s.  Blessy wanted to adapt Aadujeevitham for a big-budget film ever since he read it in 2008, "I was particularly attracted to the visual images that came through while reading the book". In the novel, Haripad native Najeeb Muhammad goes missing in Saudi Arabia where he ends up as a slave to a farm owner.  In 2009, Blessy entered into a contractual agreement with Benyamin after discussing and reaching a consensus with director Lal Jose . This was because Jose had previously expressed interest in adapting the novel to Benyamin.  Blessy began screenplay writing after obtaining the rights. He noted that the film would incorporate additional material beyond what is present in the book.  Reportedly, filming was set to begin in August 2010 at the deserts of Dubai and Rajasthan ,  but that did not happen. In 2012, Benyamin said that the film was still on discussion phase and had been postponed for the time being since its production cost was found to be not viable for a Malayalam film.  Blessy had been discussing the film with Prithviraj since 2008. In 2015, recalling the fil's stagnant development to date, Prithviraj said that there were occasions when they could work out the film, albeit with some compromises, but Blessy insisted on waiting for the right producer since he was not ready to compromise his vision.  Jet Media Productio's Jimmy Jean-Louis and Alta Global Medi's Steven Adams also joined Bless's Visual Romance Image Makers as producers.  According to Prithviraj, Blessy had conceived The Goat Life as an "event film" in the lines of Life of Pi as the narrative goes from one event to the other non-linearly.  Parallel to the new announcement, also in November 2015, Blessy told to The Hindu that he was occupied with the research work of another film, which would be disclosed later, which would go on before The Goat Life .  In May 2016, Blessy confirmed that he was busy with the pre-production work of the Hindi remake of his Malayalam film Thanmathra (2005) and The Goat Life would happen only after that.  He later updated that work of both the films were progressing simultaneously and casting and scheduling would decide which film would go on first.  Meanwhile, he was already through the production of documentary film 100 Years of Chrysostom (2018) which had begun earlier in May 2015, which he would complete in two years.  In October 2016, Blessy said Aadujeevitham would begin filming in early 2017 and release in 2018.  In mid-2017, he said that they had the screenplay ready but the locations had not been decided and production would start in November 2017 and the film would take 18 months to release.  On the challenges on adapting the novel, Blessy said, in the novel, Najeeb recollects his experience through soliloquy , which is easily conveyed through literary work, but it is difficult to depict on screen. The fil's narrative is entirely different from the book. For example, in the latter half of the book, when Arbab castigates Najeeb in Arabic , readers read it in Malayalam, whereas the film has to demonstrate how much the language distresses Najeeb. Unlike the book, the film cannot afford to be vague since viewers see everything on screen and may question the logic presented. For instance, the book says that Najeeb could not find a shadow under a stick, but there is a farm that can cast a shadow, "in a literary work, you do't have to address that because readers travel the route the writer takes them on". Moreover, the film has to show Najee's physical transformation. Above everything else, the fil's visuals must surpass those imagined by the readers.  Najeeb does not understand Arabic, the makers decided to avoid subtitles for those parts to provide viewers with the same experience as Najeeb. According to Prithviraj, "the film has this huge liberty of not having a language", as only about 20 percent of the film contains dialogues.  Casting Suriya ( top ) was offered the main lead but was subsequently replaced by Prithviraj ( bottom ). Suriya was initially considered and cast for the role of Najeeb and Blessy discussed with him, but he opted out due to busy schedules and prior commitments.  Prithviraj agreed to do the film while he was at the sets of Pokkiri Raja (2010) in 2008.  Najeeb Muhammad from Benyami's novel is partially based on the real-life experiences of Najeeb.  Prithviraj said, although he is not a pious person, Najeeb has staunch focus on faith. There is a physical, psychological, and spiritual journey for the character. For three years, he interacts more with animals than humans, so he would "become" one among.  For Najee's role, Blessy wanted an actor who could dedicate at least 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 years for the film, which Prithviraj agreed.  Prithviraj had to gain and lose weight to show Najee's physical transformation on screen, he gained weight to 98 kilograms for playing the character in the starting sequences of the film with a pot belly and had to lose weight to 67 kilograms by the end of the film. Having lost 31 kilograms, Prithviraj said he followed an unhealthy diet which he would not recommend anyone to follow. He blacked-out while filming a scene. There was always a doctor on call at the set.  As of 2015, no other actor beside Prithviraj was finalised.  In 2016, Blessy said he is scouting for actors in Somalia and such places.  In 2017, a casting call was released by the makers through social media inviting applicants for a young male and female and a middle-aged female.  In February 2018, Amala Paul confirmed through social media that she is playing Sainu.   Sainu, Najee's wife, is portrayed in different phases of her life. According to Blessy, the role would tap the potential of Amala, considering the roles she had done so far.  Beside co-producing, Haitian actor Jimmy Jean-Louis played a major role as Ibrahim Khadiri.  Omani actor Talib al Balushi played the role of Najee's boss.  Rik Aby, a Sudanese actor based in the United Arab Emirates also played a role.  Filming Although the film is set in Saudi Arabia , the production team was not granted permission to shoot there, hence they had to move to other countries.  On his decision to shoot the film in 3D , Blessy said "the 3D technology will really help in elevating the overall mood. The desert wind, a small movement of the goat, the loneliness of Najeeb ... the 3D tool will help in capturing these emotions and transforming it to a different aesthetic level".  The fil's major scenes takes place in desert places. Principal photography began on 1 March 2018 with a customary pooja function.  The first schedule began in Thiruvalla , Pathanamthitta , Kerala , where flashback scenes of Najee's life before he arrived in Saudi Arabia was shot. At that time, the plan was to complete filming in 150 days spanning 18 months.  That month, filming also took place at Muthalamada railway station in Palakkad border.  The Kerala schedule was completed by April first week.  About 25 percent of the film was finished, with major portions yet to be shot.  The second schedule began in Jordan in January 2019.  Prithviraj joined the sets by the end of that month.  The crew was stranded in Wadi Rum for 70 days during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan The subsequent schedule, originally charted from March to early April 2020 in the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan, was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan . Filming finally began on 16 March. However, Omani actor Talib al Balushi and his translator were quarantined, causing him to miss the shoot after Oman evacuated its citizens. Similarly, a Sudanese actor was quarantined,  and some actors were not able to reach the location due to the cancellation of flights .  Nevertheless, the shoot continued with Prithviraj.  After Jordan initiated lockdown , Kerala chief minister directed NORKA to provide assistance through Indian embassy .  Since international flights were cancelled, the Jordanian authorities allowed the crew to continue shooting while remaining isolated.  After eight days of filming, they were forced to stop on 24 March,  but they managed to obtain permission to shoot for another 17 days.   However, the permission was revoked on 27 March after a curfew was imposed.  Blessy then requested assistance from the Kerala government , through Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce, to repatriate them.   They stayed idle for the next 32 days, during which Prithviraj further reduced his body mass .  When restrictions eased, filming resumed in April last week  and continued until 17 May.  The 58-member crew, along with other Indian citizens, were repatriated by the Government of India as part of Vande Bharat Mission and reached India on 22 May.  In their 70-day stay in the desert camp, they filmed for 25 days.  Although filming was not finished there, crucial scenes were shot, which required them to return at a later date.  Even with their original plan, they had to return for scenes featuring an American actor. About 50 percent of the film was completed with the schedule.  The next schedule began in April 2022 at Timimoun in the Sahara desert, Algeria .  As per their plan, they needed 40 days in Algeria and another 35 days in Jordan.  Algerian schedule continued to May.  In the same month, shooting relocated to Wadi Rum, Jordan.   Jordanian schedule was completed on 14 June, thus concluding the fil's international schedules.  Filming went to Perunad , Ranni , Kerala on 22 June for the final schedule.  Jail sequence was shot there on set.  Filming in its entirety was wrapped up on 14 July 2022.  K. U. Mohanan and Sunil K. S. were the cinematographers, Resul Pookutty was the sound designer , A. Sreekar Prasad was the editor, Stephy Zaviour was the costume designer, and Ranjith Ambady was the makeup artist.  In October 2022, Prithviraj told to Variety that the film is undergoing post-production and is aiming for a film festival slot in 2023.  The film is the 2nd most expensive Malayalam film ever. Music Further information: Aadujeevitham (soundtrack) The original score and songs for the film were composed by A. R. Rahman in his third film in Malayalam after Yoddha (1992) and Malayankunju (2022).    The soundtrack featured four songs and an instrumental track with lyrics by Rafeeq Ahamed , and Vijay Yesudas , Chinmayi Sripaada , Rakshita Suresh , Sana Moussa, Raja Hasan , Murtuza and Faiz Mustafa were the singers.  A grand audio launch function of the film was held on 10 March 2024 at the Adlux International Convention Centre in Angamaly , with the fil's cast and crew members along with prominent celebrities in attendance.   However, except for the promotional video song "Hope" which released on social media platforms on the same day,  the soundtrack was released a week later.  Marketing In April 2023, Deadline Hollywood released an unexpected trailer for the film. Blessy expressed dissatisfaction, clarifying that the trailer was intended for agents for screening at film festivals and business purposes, not for public release. He emphasised that the post-production work on the clips, including colour grading and music, was incomplete, with the music only composed on a keyboard . Blessy disowned it as the official theatrical release trailer.  Despite this, the production team officially released the same trailer shortly afterward.  In late-November 2023, the official social media handles for the film were revealed. In late-December, the team asked fans to design posters for their participation at a special event with Prithviraj and Blessy.  On 10 January 2024, the first look of the film was revealed by Prabhas through his social media handles, which featured Prithviraj in a bearded and gloomy appearance as Najeeb Muhammed.   Blessy and Benyamin attended the seventh edition of the Kerala Literature Festival held on 13 January, to share their insights on the adaptation from novel to film.   Two more posters were revealed on 17 and 31 January, one featuring Prithvira's gloomy look and the other that featured the actor in a younger look, reminiscing the character earlier days.   On 11 February, the team shared a video subtitled Corona Days , revealing on the turbulent production where the team stranded in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic.  An official website for the film was launched by Blessy and Rahman in late-February 2024.   The fil's theatrical trailer was unveiled on 9 March 2024.    The trailer was overwhelmingly well received, with media outlets such as Film Companion describing the visuals as "spellbinding",  and The Indian Express -based critic compared Prithvira's performance to that of Leonardo DiCaprio's in The Revenant (2015).  Release Theatrical During the promotion of Kaapa (2022) in December 2022, Prithviraj revealed that The Goat Life would premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival if post-production work completes on time. In such a scenario, the fil's worldwide theatrical release would be in the latter half of 2023. However, if the film is not able to make it to Cannes, it will premiere at the next major film festival.  In May 2023, following the absence from Cannes, Blessy disclosed a strategy to debut the film at the Venice Film Festival , with a subsequent theatrical release in October 2023 contingent upon completing the remaining post-production works by mid-June.  In late-November 2023, it was announced that the film would be released theatrically on 10 April 2024, ahead of the Eid al-Fitr and Vishu weekend.   However, in February, the film was advanced to 28 March 2024.    The film will be distributed by Prithviraj Productions in Kerala, Hombale Films in Karnataka, Mythri Movie Makers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Red Giant Movies in Tamil Nadu and AA Films in North India.  Home media The fil's satellite and digital distribution rights were acquired by Asianet and Disney+ Hotstar , respectively, which was revealed during the audio launch.  Reception Box office On the opening day of its release, the film collected approximately ₹16.7 crores, with ₹5.63 crores coming from Kerala.  Critical response On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 86% of 7 critic' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10.  Arjun Menon of Rediff.com rated 4/5 stars and noted, " Aadujeevitham marks a new direction for Malayalam cinema, where ambition meets resources and the right people, all in favour of stories that deserve to be told on the biggest stage of them all."  Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 4/5 stars and wrote "While Blessy meticulously selected only the necessary moments for the film adaptation of The Goat Life , his script fell short throughout in building sufficient tension."

It is currently the fourth highest grossing Malayalam film of all time , third highest-grossing Malayalam film of 2024 , fifth highest-grossing South Indian film of 2024 as well as one of the highest grossing Indian films of 2024 . Plot [ edit ] Aju, Bibi and Shanthan arrive in Bangalore , Karnataka from Kerala to pursue a degree in aeronautical engineering at Vaana Veekshan College, choosing the BK Hostel (run by the college clerk BK) for its perceived freedom compared to their college accommodation. Initially, they enjoy their time there until a confrontation with Kutty, a senior student, escalates, bruising his ego. In retaliation, Kutty and his gang forcefully take the trio to his place and brutally thrash them, only to offer friendship afterward. Feeling humiliated, Aju seeks revenge and leads his friends to multiple bars in search of gangsters, eventually befriending Ranga, a prominent, eccentric and kind-hearted Malayali-Kannadiga gangster who dresses in all-white . One day after the trio gets drunk, Ranga takes them in their jeep to drop them off at their hostel, but the hostel warden warns them not to arrive late as there are rules in the hostel. So Ranga takes them to his old house to accommodate them as a note of goodwill. Disillusioned by Rang's lack of action, they realize his gang merely praises him while engaging in minor violence. When Bibi confronts Ranga about the incident with Kutty, Ranga unleashes his fury during the college Holi celebration, beating up Kutty and his gang in front of everyone. They face expulsion after being unable to pass exams and because of their association with Ranga, but are given a second chance with assurances of passing all future exams. After their initial victory against Kutty, their association with Ranga begins to consume their lives, affecting their studies. They are unable to focus on their studies as Ranga keeps involving them in his high-octane lifestyle of chases, fights and parties. After a night of one such revelry, the three of them discover a grim truth in the house related to Rang's past. After this discovery, the trio meets Ranga and tries to express their desire to sever ties with him, by trying to reveal that they only befriended him for revenge but hold back when they see Ranga threaten to kill two of his gang members trying to leave the gang. The tri's troubles escalate when they are kidnapped by Reddy, Rang's former boss. Reddy accuses Ranga of stealing his brand and seeks their help to eliminate him by asking them to give him (Reddy) a call whenever they next encounter Ranga. Fleeing from Redd's threats they go back to their house. Unable to handle staying in the house, the trio decides to switch off their phones and leave for a different hostel in Tumkur. They manage to study there, meanwhile Ranga keeps frantically searching for the boys. The boys finally decide to confront Ranga and make up a plan to call Reddy when he is alone. They eventually pick up Rang's call and ask him to meet face-to-face in his accommodation he set up for them, in order to sever all ties with him and his gang. The boys proceed to open up to Ranga as to the fact that they only befriended him to keep away Kuttan and his gang, and proceeded to tell him just how negatively he had impacted their life after that chance encounter. A now-agitated Ranga calls his gang to the house. The anxious boys, now fearing for their life, try concocting a plan on the spot, and finally, they call Reddy and his gang (as he had offered them a means to betray Ranga after kidnapping them earlier), in order to get rid of Rang's presence in their life. Reddy and his goons arrive before Rang's gang, and Reddy thanks the boys for their timely tip-off of Rang's whereabouts and proclaims that h'll deal with the rest. Ranga thus realises that the boys had double-crossed him. Distraught at their betrayal, Ranga broke his vow of not getting personally involved in fights, and faces Redd's gang alone in hand-to-hand combat, and emerges victorious. Further incensed by their betrayal, he chases them across the house (with his now-arrived goons blocking the exits and windows of the house), and reveals that he kept the boys with him as no one had gotten close to him in his life unless they needed something from him. Realizing their mistake, they apologize to Ranga. Ranga begrudgingly lets them go (after going through an emotional turmoil fuelled further by a call from Bib's mother where she, in a concerning manner, asks about Ranga and Bib's wellbeing), and warns them to not fail in a single exam. Aju and Bibi are unable to clear their exams by failing in one subject, while Shanthan passes them. They encounter Ranga, now clad in all-black attire as new look, outside the college. Ranga humorously punishes Aju and Bibi for their inability to pass all the exams.

The fil's title Aavesham was announced in May 2023. Madhavan wrote the script during early-December 2022 and completed within February 2023 during the period when his debut film Romancham (2022) was delayed from October 2022 to February 2023.  Though it was reported that the film is a spin-off of Romancham , Madhavan later clarified that Aavesham is a standalone film and has no connections with Romancham .  The technical crew consisted of Sushin Shyam , Sameer Thahir , Vivek Harshan and Ashwini Kale as music composer, cinematographer, editor and production designer respectively.  Casting [ edit ] Fahadh plays the role of Ranga, a Bangalore -based gangster;  He was featured in a thick handlebar moustache and an all-white attire in a leaked picture from the fil's production in May 2023.  Fahadh attributed that he had not explored such characters before, which led to him agreeing to the story, adding that "Jithu  gave me a very clear understanding of who Ranga would be. However, we finalised the look and attire after we started filming for the movie."  Compared to his previous films, Fahad's character would be loud in the film and would speak in a mixture of Malayalam and Kannada , resembling how gangsters from the city would speak.

Throughout the film, Faha's character Ranga appears in an all-white attire wearing gold chains, except for the climactic portions where Fahadh would appear in an all-black attire.  Rang's younger version sports a trimmed deep fade hairstyle and wears a windbreaker , which resembles Dali Benssalah's look from the music video of the French musical duo The Blaze's single "Territory" (2017) and also British boxer Naseem Hamed .  Music [ edit ] The fil's soundtrack was composed by Sushin Shyam with lyrics written by Vinayak Sasikumar and featured nine songs performed by independent artists.

More than 50,000 admissions from Kerala theatres were recorded from 567 tracked shows.  The film, along with several other Malayalam films, were not released at PVR INOX multiplex chains across India in response to a dispute between the Film Employees Federation of Kerala and the authorities of PVR INOX management over Virtual Print Fee , as well as the federatio's plans on distributing films through their newly established content providing service over Qube Cinema Technologies ,the primary content provider for PVR INOX theatres.   However, the ban was lifted on 13 April and the film was released in the multiplex chains the following day.  Prior to the fil's release, the film garnered U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with the duration of the final edit being 157 minutes.

Critical response [ edit ] Goutham S of Pinkvilla gave 4/5 stars and wrote " Aavesham is ideally one of those movies that you could enjoy in theaters if you love a comedy film with a wild ride happening. The show is definitely run by Fahadh Faasil who is all set to entertain you with a great array of actors supporting him."  Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Jithu Madhava's gangster comedy is arguably Fahadh Faasi's first all-encompassing masala film and the actor unabashedly uses it to silence all the criticisms against him that he ca't handle mass characters."  Anna Mathews of The Times of India gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Apart from scripting superb side characters, Jithu Madhavan has crafted the comic timing of his dialogues well."  Janani K of India Today gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Aavesham is truly an enjoyable affair with brilliantly choreographed action sequences and comedy sequences. If yo're a fan of Fahadh Faasil, then Aavesham will prove why you became his fan in the first place."  Nirmal Jovial of The Week gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "The film maintains a celebratory mood from beginning till end."  Arjun Menon of Rediff rated 3/5 stars and applauded "Aavesham is smooth in its storytelling and leaves a chilling aftertaste, thanks to its one-of-a-kind anti-hero."  Swathi P Ajith of Onmanorama termed it as "the perfect choice if yo're seeking laughter and entertainment in equal measure."  S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote " Romancham director Jithu Madhavan returns with his sophomore effort, that is held afloat by Fahadh Faasil running riot in one of his most colourful characters."  Box office [ edit ] On the opening day of its release, the film grossed ₹3.9 crores worldwide, gaining the first spot between concurrent releases Varshangalku Shesham and Jai Ganesh .  The fil's ticket sales were further boosted by its positive word of mouth,  which helped it to earn a total of ₹18.75 crores domestically on Vishu holiday.

Plot [ edit ] In 17th century Malabar , Thevan and Koran escape the clutches of the Portuguese slave trade in Ponnani and flee to the east. At night, they camp at the banks of the Bharathappuzha River, but Koran is killed by a Yakshi . Thevan runs away, discovering an abandoned mana in the morning. While stealing a coconut, he is apprehended by the hous's cook. He is brought before the lord of the mana, Kodumon Potti, who asks his whereabouts and upon learning he is a Paanan , requests him to sing a song. He compliments Thevan on the song and insists that he stay the night, despite his desire to leave. The cook, while showing Thevan his room, discourages him from asking questions about the house or the Lor's background. Over the next few days, he discovers from the cook that the Potti is a descendant of Chudalan Potti, who was gifted a demon helper, a Chathan , by the goddess Varahi . His constant torture of the Chathan turned it lunatic, and it went on to kill Chudalan Potti and his family. Kodumon Potti eventually defeated the Chathan and chained him in the mansio's attic. One day, Thevan sees the cook digging a grave in the backyard, presumably for himself. Terrified, he tries to leave, but is unable to. He then realizes that he has lost his memory and that he has been trapped in the manor for months. The cook tells Thevan that the grave is not meant for him, but for Kodumon; the Kodumon downstairs is in fact the Chathan in disguise, and he imprisoned the real Kodumon in the attic and drove him insane, leading to his eventual death. The only way that the cook and Thevan could escape the manor is by defeating the Chathan by dousing an ever-burning lamp located in a secret chamber in the granary, and then trapping it in a special chest. During an argument, the cook steals the key to the chamber from the Chatha's waist. He opens the chamber and blows out the lamp, rendering the Chathan weak. Thevan and the cook set fire to the Chatha's disguised form, and the creature inside emerges. The cook, now revealed to be Kodumo's illicit son, attempts to put on the ring that will give him command over the Chathan and take over the mana, but is stopped by Thevan, who believes that the rin's power will corrupt him. The two start fighting while the fire destroys the manor and it collapses over them. Thevan is shown walking away from the ruins of the mana but is attacked by the cook. During the struggle the cook realizes that he is not the real Thevan, but the Chathan in disguise. The real Thevan is then shown to have died as a result of the mana collapsing. Terrified, the cook runs away into the forest and comes across a Portuguese soldier while crossing a river. Thinking that it is one of the Chatha's tricks, he tries to attack the soldier but gets gunned down. A battalion of Portuguese soldiers emerge from the forest, cross the river, and march towards the now destroyed manor, while the Chathan is seen walking through the forest, wearing the ring.

Akshay P R of DT Next rated 4/5 and wrote,"Director Rahul Sadasivan is yet again exploring the haunted mansion theme but is quite different from his previous film'Bhoothakala' as it was more of dealing with our own past, but Bramayugam (The Age of Madness) is more of a black and white film, in the horror-thriller genre to explore the power pattern in history."  Nikhil Sebastian of Pinkvilla rated 4/5 and verdicted,"Bramayugam stands out as a cinematic gem that transcends the typical horror genre. With a captivating blend of mystery, drama, and the rich mythical folklore of Kerala, it offers a compelling narrative that captivates audiences".  Sanjith Sidhardhan of OTTplay rated 3.5/5 and reviewed,"Mammootty’s Bramayugam benefits richly from its engaging screenplay, cinematography and performances, which makes the viewer forget that it’s a black-and-white film and lets you enjoy the magic of cinema."  Reviewing for The News Minute , Sukanya Shaji stated,"The heart of this monochrome horror thriller is, of course, Mammootty. Even as Potti makes your stomach churn in disgust, Mammootty makes you want to clap for his versatility as a performer. Arjun Asokan and Sidharth Bharathan perhaps have more screen time than Mammootty, and make good use of it, though some scenes make you think that the characters could have benefitted from the experienced craft of more seasoned actors."  The New Indian Express' Vignesh Madhu rated 3.5/5 and reviewed, "While Bhoothakaalam saw Rahul expertly handling psychology and supernatural elements, he blends folklore and horror in Bramayugam to create a terrifying atmosphere where almost every moment is an event.  Nirmal Jovial from The Week rated 4/5 and verdicted,"Bramayugam has a major reliance on visual storytelling, but its memorability is't derived from visual gimmicks or jump scares. Instead, i's the intricate world-building orchestrated by Sadasivan, with significant support from Ramakrishnan, within a confined yet evocative setting, that truly captivated this reviewer."  Firstpost rated 3/5 and reviewed, "What really drives the film home is the performance by the lead actors. Mammootty is going all out with his out of box choices because this is probably the most sinister, and terrifying character that I have seen him portray. Everything about this film is experiential. Starting from the dark insides of the theaters to the sound and music in the film. It is ethereal how the beautifully all aspects of the film come together to achieve this feat.  Janani K of India Today rated the film 3/5 and said, "‘Bramayugam’, with an intriguing story, gifts you an immersive experience. And Mammootty strikes yet again".  Deccan Herald' s Arun Antony rated 4/5 and reviewed,"Arjun Ashokan surprises as the paanan but Siddharth Bharathan stands out as the cook. Overall ‘Bramayugam’ makes a lasting impression and anyone who is a fan of ‘Tumbbad’ should watch it".  Anna Mathews of The Times of India rated 3.5/5 and wrote,"The script,the direction and art direction cultivates the eerieness and makes the film scary. But the story with bits of class politics and religious philosophy sometimes lacks a flow and does not makes things very clear."  Reviewing for Onmanorama , Swathi P Ajith wrote,"The film seamlessly merges horror, thriller, and folktale elements, with horror subtly woven into the shadows and sounds. Rather than relying on jump scares, the movie crafts a claustrophobic atmosphere, gradually building a sense of terror."  Analysing the film for Onmanorama , Sajesh Mohan wrote about the power politics depicted in the movie,"Rahu's'Bramayuga' and Jij's'My Dear Kuttichatha' depict the manipulation tactics of power-hungry people who ensnare gods and demigods like Chathan, Karinkali, Yakshi, etc., exploiting their vulnerabilities to instil fear and exert control over fellow beings."  Box office [ edit ] The film collected ₹ 3 crore in Kerala on its opening day and grossed over ₹ 32 crore (US$3.8 million) globally in the first weekend.

Mahendran as Swaminathan, Swam's lodge owner Kalesh Ramanand as music director Indradhanush "Indra" Production [ edit ] Development [ edit ] On 13 July 2023, Vineeth Sreenivasan announced his collaboration once again with producer Visakh Subramaniam of Merryland Cinemas , following the success of Hridayam (2022), for their second project together, titled Varshangalkku Shesham . The film also brings back Pranav Mohanlal and Kalyani Priyadarshan from their previous film.  Vineeth described that the film will revolve around a bunch of friends.  In an interview, talking about his influences, Vineeth recalled how he listened to his father Sreenivasan's stories about his early life in Madras and also the experiences of his contemporaries in the film industry. During his school days, Vineeth avidly read popular Malayalam film magazines , such as Nana , Vellinakshatram , and Chithrabhumi , which featured articles and interviews with those working in cinema. These stories, along with the imagined picture of Madras they presented, served as inspirations for Varshangalkku Shesham . He also recalled how, during stage shows, actors Mukesh and Innocent would entertain the team with anecdotes from their lives in Madras and their experiences in the cinema world. Vineeth himself being a resident of Chennai (formerly Madras), describes the city as "a place that had always fascinated" him. Varshangalkku Shesham features Madras in the 1970s and 1980s, spanning 50 years from early 1970s, showcasing the evolution of the film industry during this period; the film "attempts to showcase that arc of time, the mood and the style of working".  Vineeth had the story in mind since his college days but lacked confidence to execute it. After Hridayam , he gained confidence to make it into fruition. He began screenwriting in 2022.  Vineeth revealed that the story of Varshangalkku Shesham was inspired by two screenplays written by Sreenivasan.  Vineeth also integrated some inputs from director Priyadarshan , to whom he shared the screenplay. Priyadarshan narrated an incident that occurred in a film studio, which Vineeth incorporated into the film.  Casting [ edit ] During the fil's announcement, the initial cast included Pranav Mohanlal , Dhyan Sreenivasan , Aju Varghese , Kalyani Priyadarshan , Basil Joseph , Vineeth, Neeraj Madhav , Neeta Pillai , Sai Aadya Bhumi , Arjun Lal, Nikhil Nair, Shaan Rahman , and Nivin Pauly .   Further cast members were revealed in the fil's teaser, with Y. G. Mahendran , Harikrishnan , Anjali Nair , Darshana Sudarshanan, Deepak Parambol , Bhagath Manuel , Ashwath Lal, Sreeram Ramachandran , Krishnachandran , TSR among others appear in supporting roles.  Vineeth had Pranav, Dhyan, and Nivin in mind during the scripting phase itself.  According to Vineeth, the film will not work without the three. About Kalyan's casting, he said: "Everyone suggested Kalyani after listening to the story".  Vineeth based Prana's character after actor Murali , whom he observed during the filming of Champakulam Thachan (1992). He recalls seeing Murali walking towards their hotel from a distance, dressed in a jubba and mundu , with a sling bag on his shoulder, while singing a poem. Vineeth described the characterisation as "a man flowing in the wind". He also named the character after the actor.  The film marks the reunion of Pranav and Kalyani with Vineeth after Hridayam .  Vineeth collaborates with Nivin after an eight-year hiatus. According to Vineeth, his character drives the story forward once he is introduced, with Vineeth noting that Nivin was in his "best form".   Dhyan underwent a weight loss of 12 kilograms to prepare for his role in the film.  Shaan, who previously collaborated with Vineeth as a music director in his earlier projects, made his acting debut with Varshangalkku Shesham .  Although Vineeth had previously approached Shaan for a brief role in Thira (2013), he declined it. However, he accepted this offer, influenced by Vineet's confidence in him. Shaan underwent a makeover, donning an outfit, wig, and mustache for his role.  Vineeth had approached director Lokesh Kanagaraj for a role as he wanted a "Tamil-speaking actor with a calm demeanor", but Kanagaraj declined it due to his directorial commitments. Consequently, Kalesh Ramanand, who had previously appeared in Hridayam , was chosen for the role, as suggested by Visakh.   Vineeth reminisced about how several actors in the film juggled shooting dates with multiple filmmakers, unlike in Hridayam , where most of them were early in their careers. He described it as "a wonderful coincidence that we were able to bring them all together for this film".  Filming [ edit ] Principal photography began on 26 October 2023. The following day, filming was relocated to Aroor .  The fil's art director, Nimesh Thanur, constructed sets at Aroor, replicating Kodambakkam and film studios of Madras . Additionally, some old studio scenes were shot in Coimbatore and Pollachi .  It took two months to build the sets.  Vineeth said that director Priyadarshan had provided some important details in the design of Swam's Lodge, one of the major backdrops of the film, when he narrated the screenplay to him.   The first filming schedule was concluded in the fourth week of November after 23 days shooting.  Nivin joined the film for the second schedule in Munnar in early December.  The entire filming process wrapped up on 20 December 2023.  The film was shot over a span of 40 days across more than 50 locations, involving over 200 crew members.  Although the film depicts Chennai in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not shot in Chennai.  Post-production [ edit ] Dubbing for the film commenced in early January 2024 in Chennai .  The dubbing process was completed on the same month.   It was followed by the final stage of editing in that month.  The audio mixing of the film had been completed by March 2024.   Music [ edit ] Varshangalkku Shesham marks the debut feature film composition work of Amrit Ramnath, son of singer-composer Bombay Jayashri . He was until then composing independent tracks for some years.  Ramnath started composing for the film while he was at the hospital where his mother was admitted and composed three tracks during the period.  Manu Manjith , Vaisakh Sugunan, Jayashri, and Sreenivasan wrote the lyrics.  Think Music released the fil's soundtrack album on 7 April 2024 which consisted of 14 songs.  Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] Varshangalkku Shesham was theatrically released worldwide on 11 April 2024 during the Ramadan and Vishu weekend, along with Aavesham and Jai Ganesh .  The date was announced through a first-look poster released by director Karan Johar in December 2023.   Distribution [ edit ] The film was distributed by the production company Merryland Cinemas in Kerala, while Phars Film acquired the distribution rights in overseas territories.   Sakthi Film Factory acquired the theatrical rights for film distribution across Tamil Nadu.  Home media [ edit ] The film starting streaming on SonyLIV from 7 June 2024. Reception [ edit ] Critical reception [ edit ] Varshangallku Shesham received mixed reviews from critics as well as audience upon release.  Divya Nair of Rediff.com rated 3/5 stars and stated "Vineeth Sreenivasan deserves applause for striving to blend the past with the present and revoking your memories."  Writing for the The Times of India , Anna Mathews praised the performances of Nivin Pauly and Basil Joseph.  Writing for Hindustan Times , Latha Srinivasan praised the performances of the cast and Vineeth Srinivasa's direction as earnest, but felt the film was lengthy and melodramatic.  Cris of The News Minute praised the film as an ode to cinema and friendship.  Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express , however, criticised the fil's writing and Pranav Mohanla's acting, yet commended Nivin Paul's performance.  Box office [ edit ] The film grossed over ₹80 crore in its theatrical run.

On a side note, for anyone who is a fan of Jawan or Tamil cinema in particular, make sure to stick around for the tail-end for a surprise, potentially leading to a sequel."  Sanjith Sidhardhan of OTTplay gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Mammootty aces the five action scenes in Vysakh’s directorial, but it doesn’t rise above that.

Anandu Suresh of The New Indian Express rated 2/5 stars and wrote "Even as the script drags on endlessly, Vysak's movie is predominantly salvaged by Mammoott's no-holds-barred performance, operating in top gear, complemented by Raj B Shett's remarkable presence as the villain."  Latha Srinivasan of Hindustan Times wrote "The movie uses an interplay of comedy and fights to move from one situation to the next. Unfortunately, most of the comedy falls flat so it’s upto the fight sequences to save the day".  S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote "Vysakh’s ‘Turbo’ will be remembered for recycling all the old tropes that have been part of its genre since time immemorial and for its reluctance to try anything new."

2024 Indian Malayalam crime thriller film Abraham Ozler is a 2024 Indian Malayalam -language crime thriller film co-produced and directed by Midhun Manuel Thomas and written by Randheer Krishnan.    The film stars Jayaram in the titular role alongside Mammootty in extended cameo appearance, Anaswara Rajan , Anoop Menon , Arjun Ashokan , Saiju Kurup , Arya Salim , Senthil Krishna , Jagadish and Dileesh Pothan in supporting roles.  The film revolves around ACP Abraham Ozle's efforts to investigate the death of an IT employee and capture a serial killer, only known as "Birthday Killer". The music was composed by Midhun Mukundan while the cinematography was handled by Theni Eswar and editing by Shameer Muhammed . Abraham Ozler was initially set to be released on 25 December 2023, but the release date was postponed to 11 January 2024. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its acting, cinematography, direction, and musical score, but criticism for its script. The film earned around ₹ 40.53 crore worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film of Jayara's career.   Plot [ edit ] ACP Abraham Ozler  finds his life shattered when a fake police call lures him away, leading to the brutal death of his wife Maneesha and daughter Jenny. The main culprit is Vineeth, who wanted to avenge Ozler for arresting him in a narcotics case. Vineeth confesses to killing Aneesha and Jenny, cutting them into pieces and burying their body parts somewhere in a forest but claims he does't remember exactly where because he was on a high dosage of drugs.  Ozler gets distraught about his famil's death and struggles to find closure because their bodies are never found. Three years later, Ozler, who is haunted by hallucinations and insomnia , investigates a series of murders with his subordinates SI Divya Sreedharan and Sijo T Venu. The two killers, one driving a pickup truck and the other posing as a surgeon, leave cryptic notes at the crime scenes. They name the killer as "Birthday killer". As the team unravels the connections, they discover Krishnandas, a man using an artificial larynx , as a key suspect. They also learn that Krishnadas, a child prodigy singer, had lost his voice in a failed surgery. Delving into the past, Ozler discovers a shared history among the victi's parents: Shivakumar and Selvaraj were postgraduate medical students at Kozhikode Medical College in 1989. Shivakumar, Selvaraj, a retired police surgeon Xavi Punnoose and Alexander Joseph were all found to have been friends and PG batchmates. They were heard to have gotten into an accident, after which they parted ways. Krishnadas is captured while he kidnaps Alexander. But even as Krishnadas is in Ozle's custody, Xavi is kidnapped. As the truth surfaces, the real Alexander is revealed to be another person. Alexander is arrested as soon as he inflicts the first cut on Xav's body to kill him. Once in custody, Alexander narrates the flashback to Ozler and his team. Alexander was a dedicated PG student at surgery department of Kozhikode Medical College . Xavi, a fellow PG student of surgery, is not as good a surgeon as Alexander, and he is jealous of Alexander. Shivakumar, a PG student of General Medicine, despises Alexander for being in a relationship with a first year MBBS student Suja Jayadev whom Shivakumar had been pursuing. Selvaraj, a PG student of anaesthesia, and a junkie who used to be on drugs even while on duty, was found to use drugs from operation theatre stock by Alexander who then reports this to the college and  Selvaraj is suspended. Professional jealousy of Xavi, fuelled by Shivakumar, led to Xavi orchestrating a failed surgery resulting in Krishnadas losing his voice forever. Alexander reports Xav's intentional act to seniors, and Xavi, as well as Alexander being the first assistant at the surgery, are suspended from college. Xavi is blacklisted by his professors and told he shall never be allowed to do a surgery on a living human being again. Selvaraj, Xavi and Shivakumar then go ahead to severely injure Alexander, leading him into coma. They made up an accident scene, faked injuries on themselves, and told everyone that a drunk Alexander took them for a drive and crashed the car. Alexander lays in a vegetative state for months and Suja goes into deep depression seeing this. One day, doctors suggested that they remove Alexande's life support and allow him to die peacefully. A depressed Suja becomes heartbroken after overhearing this and in a fit of emotion, she commits suicide by jumping in front of a moving bus. In a fateful irony, Alexander survives life support removal and with years and years of nursing care, regains movement, although he had dissociative amnesia, causing him to forget most of the events of his PG time, including Suja and the cruelty done by Xavi and his friends. 3–4 years ago, Alexander sees a TV programme featuring Krishnadas, wherein some old videos of him singing are shown. This triggers his memories and Alexander slowly recollects all the past events. He meets up with Krishnadas who had become wayward after losing his voice, and together they plan the murders. The motive behind the murders were to seek revenge on those who ruined their lives. Back to the present, Xavi meets Alexander and Krishnadas in Ozle's custody and has no remorse at all. Ozler feels very bad in saving Xavi and tells that he needs to die. A surprising turn occurs as Xavi dies on stage at the release ceremony of his autobiography, with forensic surgeon Dr Satheesh Madhavan revealing to Ozler that Alexander had poisoned him with a bacteria-infected surgical ink before making cuts on his body. Later, it is shown that Shivakumar is found dead, and that Selvaraj became an alcoholic and his wife leaves him realising that he caused their so's murder. On his routine visit to Vineeth in prison, Ozler unexpectedly encounters Alexander and Krishnadas in the prison. Alexander cryptically utters " Bone Residue", hinting at an unresolved truth about Ozle's family. Ozler confronts Vineeth, realizing that there is no bone residue on the weapon he allegedly used in the murders. Vineeth challenges Ozler to dig deeper for the truth.

However, the commencement of shooting did't occur due to various reasons. It was during that time that director John Manthrikkal narrated a story to Midhun which was written by ortho surgeon Dr. Randheer Krishnan. He liked the story and decided to direct the film.  In an interview with Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express , Midhun revealed that the fil's titular protagonist was named after the Canadian physician William Osler , regarded as the'Father of Modern Medicin'. He also revealed that he had initially included a backstory, explaining that Abraham Ozle's father, a doctor, named his son after his favorite physician with the hope that Abraham would also become a physician like his father.  The film marked Midhu's return to direction after a four-year hiatus. Meanwhile he had  penned the screenplay for Garudan (2023) and Phoenix (2023).  Casting [ edit ] Midhun approached Jayaram to play the titular role.  Initially, Jayaram was hesitant to commit to the project as he believed that it was unlike any film  he had done till now. He believed it was a heavy character and had to appear in two timelines with different looks.  However, he agreed to play the role as Midhun convinced him. In preparing for the role, Jayaram put in some weight and grew a long beard with a tired look to fit the character.  Abraham Ozler marks Jayara's second Malayalam venture since 2019. There were reports that Mammootty would have a 15-minute cameo appearance in the film which was denied.  Reports suggested that Mammootty would have a screen-time of over 45 minutes in the film, and it was also reported that he would be playing a negative role, which was unconfirmed.  Regarding Mammoott's cameo, Jayaram revealed that Mammootty was not the first choice to play the role of Alexander. The makers approached actors Sathyaraj , R. Sarathkumar , Prakash Raj , and others.  Midhun said that, when he narrated the story of Abraham Ozler to Mammootty, he liked the script and asked him if he could play the antagonist.  Midhun was apprehensive about casting Mammootty. However, Jayaram convinced him to give the role to Mammootty.  Midhun met Mammootty again, who consented to play the role of Alexander.  Filming [ edit ] The project was announced on 19 May 2023.  Principal photography began on 20 May 2023 in Mission Quarters in Thrissur .  Producer Irshad M. Hassan performed the switch-on ceremony.  The first scene was reportedly shot between Jayaram and Sai Kumar.  Apart from Thrissur, Palakkad , Coimbatore , Idukki and Wayanad were the other shooting locations.  The filming wrapped up on 14 November 2023.  Music [ edit ] The fil's music was composed by Midhun Mukundan . It consists of one track, Poomaname , from the 1985 film Nirakkoottu . The track was originally composed by Shyam and the lyrics were written by Poovachal Khader . The song was sung by Nitin K. Siva, while the original song was by K. S. Chithra , G. Venugopal and K. G. Markose . Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] The film was initially scheduled to release on 25 December 2023, on the occasion of Christmas.

Nikhil Sebastian of Pinkvilla gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Abraham Ozler falls into the category of another half-baked thriller, relying on the performances of the actors and a brilliant original score."  Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Midhun Manuel Thoma' film can be dubbed as a crime thriller that meets the essential criteria for the genre. However, determining whether it has done a good job requires more than a simple yes/no answer."  S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote "The Jayaram-starrer is marred by generic treatment to the serial killer genre, with a cameo from superstar Mammootty offering only a temporary relief."  Vishal Menon of FIlm Companion wrote "By reinventing Jayaram as an actor and by infusing so much information into a stereotypical thriller, Abraham Ozler remains fairly engaging even if yo've seen it all before."  Princy Alexander of Onmanorama wrote "The initial feeling of repetitiveness affects the thrills in the first half. However, true to the expression "to end with a bang," Midhun employs the right tactics in the second half to provide viewers with a more than satisfactory conclusion."

Malaikottai Vaaliban was released in theatres worldwide on 25 January 2024, coinciding with the Republic Day weekend. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised the cinematography, art direction, production values and performances (especially that of Mohanlal), while criticism was aimed at the direction, screenplay, editing and fight sequences. The film was a box office bomb . Plot [ edit ] Malaikottai Vaaliban, an undefeated aged drifting warrior, establishes himself as a hero reigning over a vast desert region. Vaaliban travels with mentor/father figure, Ayyanar, and his son, Chinnappaiyyan, who energizes the crowd with drums and chants during Vaaliba's arena fights. Vaaliban is an orphan, whom Ayyanar had adopted when he was a newborn from the hands of his deceased mother. Vaaliban proceeds to Adivaarithur for his next fight, where they encounter a lady named Jamanthipoovu, who limps in front of them and requests for a ride on their cart since she cannot walk. Chinnappaiyyan and Ayyanar agree to take her with them and she accompanies them on their journey. In Adivaarithur, Vaaliban defeats the reigning champion following the customary practice of claiming the ex-champio's house and wife as his own house and wife. After a brief stay there, Vaaliban encounters a dancer , Rangapattinam Rangarani, at a betting parlour in Nooraanathalayur. Vaaliban also clashes with Chamathakan, blocking his advances. Angered and humiliated, Chamathakan challenges Vaaliban to a fight in his village, Mangodu, against their most powerful fighter, Mangottu Mallan. The next morning, Vaaliban arrives at Mangodu to fight him. Despite Chamathaka's famil's deceitful tactics, Vaaliban emerges victorious, stripping them of their honor. In retaliation, Chamathakan embarks on a killing spree out of shame, seeking revenge against Vaaliban. Meanwhile, Vaaliban returns to Ambathoor Malaikottai, where he began his journey, and challenges the Portuguese fighter king, Macaulay Maharaj, to take over his reign. However, Chamathakan, seeking vengeance, poisons Vaaliban before the fight with Maharaj and surprisingly Lady Macaulay as a duo, temporarily blinding him, which leads to him being captured by the Portuguese soldiers. Miraculously, he recovers the next day and defeats the Portuguese, with the help of the slaves of Ambathoor, who were liberated by Rangaran's aid, Thenamma. Later that night, outside of Malaikottai, Rangarani proposes to Vaaliban, who rejects her proposal and tells her that he cannot love anyone. Hearing this, she becomes heartbroken and reveals this to Thenamma, who starts scheming evil things in her mind and promises to help her make Vaaliban fall in love with her. Celebrating their victory, they all stop for the Thiruchenthooru festival, where Jamanthi reveals to Vaaliban that she is pregnant with Chinnappaiyya's child. He is overjoyed when he hears this and wishes good health and prosperity to the child and Jamanthi. Rangarani eavesdrops and hears the conversation, but misunderstands the chil's father to be Vaaliban, judging by the way Vaaliban spoke to Jamanthi. Rangarani reports this to Thenamma, who puts her plan in action. She speaks to Chinnappaiyyan and tells him that Jamanthi is pregnant with Vaaliba's child, which angers him and sets out to kill Vaaliban. During the temple festivities, while they are all celebrating, Vaaliban senses Chamathaka's presence in the crowd and attempts to find Chamathakan, but in vain. Vaaliban senses that he might be near Jamanthi and races towards her to protect her, but due to the huge crowd present there, Vaaliban is not able to make it in time and he kills her. While mourning Jamanth's death, Vaaliban senses Chamathaka's presence in the crowd once again. He sees a person coming to attack him and stabs the person multiple times. Though Vaaliban thinks that he has killed Chamathakan, it is revealed to be Chinnappaiyyan, whom Vaaliban could not recognise as they were all wearing face masks. Chamathakan considers his revenge fulfilled and leaves the area. These events drive a wedge between Vaaliban and Ayyanar. Ayyanar pledges vengeance and declares him as his sworn enemy. While wandering away, Ayyanar comes across Chamathakan and they share a drink. He reveals to Chamathakan that Vaaliban is not an orphan as he was previously made to believe, but the son of his mutant fighter rival, Malaivettai Vaaliban. Malaivettai had defeated Ayyanar and took his wife with him, as a result of which, he unfortunately became Malaivetta's servant. Soon, Ayyana's ex-wife became pregnant with Vaaliban; Malaivettai left her to conquer the world, leaving her under the care of Ayyanar in the monsoon season. As soon as he was born, Ayyanar murdered his ex-wife and abducted him to train him as a weapon against his own biological father. Ayyanar poisons Chamathakan and wanders off into the desert. The film ends with the revelation of Ayyanar revealing that the fighter, which he will bring to fight against Vaaliban will be his own father, paving way for the sequel.

On 25 October 2022, John & Mary Creative , the newly launched production house of former minister Shibu Baby John , announced their debut film which brought together director Lijo Jose Pellissery and actor Mohanlal for the first time.   The title was announced on 22 December. At that time, media reported that the film is a period drama in which Mohanlal portrays the role of a wrestler.  The screenplay was written by P. S. Rafeeque . Pellissery retained most of the technical crew from his previous films. Tinu Pappachan was appointed as the associate director.  The film credits Shibu Baby John and Achu Baby John from John & Mary Creative, Kochumon Century from Century Films , Jacob K. Babu from Maxlab Cinemas and Entertainments , and Vikram Mehra and Siddharth Anand Kumar from Yoodlee Films as producers.  Additionally, Pellisser's Amen Movie Monastery also joined the production.  Pellissery conceived the initial story during the COVID-19 lockdown and later expanded it into a narrative that blurs time and space. He collaborated with Rafeeque to develop the screenplay. Pellissery chose him for his belief that Rafeeque could contribute to a language and vocabulary "rooted in the soil". The film was originally planned in Tamil . In the scripting process, Pellissery transformed the concept into a broader canvas, particularly in terms of characters and landscape. He drew inspirations from around the world, incorporating elements from Japanese folklore and Samurai culture to Westerns , among other sources.  According to John, Malaikottai Vaaliban is a "complete action cinema".  Mohanlal stated that the film is crafted in the style of a Western film , and the storyline is not confined to any specific time period.  The narrative unfolds in its own world , transcending space and time, blending philosophical and spiritual elements. The film allows for individual interpretations, with Mohanlal stating, "each viewe's perspective would be as diverse and unique as strokes of a painting". Additionally, he suggested that it could also be perceived as a cinematic zen story.  Pelissery added that the film is without any particular genre and can be perceived as a cinematic rendition of an Amar Chitra Katha .  According to producer Siddharth Anand Kumar, "it is the kind of epic story we have grown up reading", it may look like a mythological story, "but it is outside of the mythological space".  Casting [ edit ] Commenting on Mohanla's casting, Pellisserry emphasized that, "this is a period film which demanded someone with the gravitas of Mohanlal".  Describing the character, Mohanlal said that there is an anonymity surrounding Vaaliban, as he can be anyone and possess any ability.  In November 2022, the team entered into discussions with actress Radhika Apte for the lead female role, according to reports.  There were also reports of Vidyut Jammwal and Rajpal Yadav being considered for roles in the film.  In December, Kannada actor and stand-up comedian Danish Sait confirmed that he would make his Malayalam cinema debut in the film, growing a beard for his role, which contrasts with his typical clean-shaven appearance.  Sai's character was designed to emulate the traits of a hyena , a concept developed during discussions between Mohanlal and Pellisery.  Sait underwent specific preparations for his role. He was asked to watch hyena videos to capture the characte's behaviour and laughter.  In the film, he spots a half-shaven head and beard look.  Sait himself dubbed his voice in Malayalam, Hindi , Kannada , and Tamil language versions of the film. He was first considered for another Pellissery film, which was postponed, prior to his casting in Malaikottai Vaaliban .  Marathi actress Sonalee Kulkarni also made her Malayalam debut with the film, describing it as a "musical period drama".  She plays Rangapattinam Rangarani, an actress and dancer. Pellissery discovered Kulkarni from a Marathi film, Natarang (2010), where she played a lavani dancer, which she performs in Malaikottai Vaaliban as well. Describing her character, Kulkarni said that Rangarani has "a touch of Maharashtra " but comes from somewhere else; her outfit and looks are a fusion of many Indian cultures, "there is far too much diversity in this film because every character, not just Rangarani, is from distinct lands".  In January 2023, reports suggested that the team was in talks with Tamil actors Kamal Haasan and Jiiva for two brief roles.  It was later reported that Haasan declined the role as he wanted to focus on his work in Indian 2 .  Kannada actor Rishab Shetty dismissed reports about his casting, clarifying that although he was approached for a role, he turned down the role in favor of a Kannada film .  In the turn of events, Mohanlal himself was cast in a second role that unfolds during the fil's climax, originally considered for either Haasan or Shetty.  Malayali dancer Manoj Moses secured an important role,  as did Bengali actress Katha Nandi, who described her part as a "strong female character".  Moses was cast because Pellissery wanted someone who knows acrobatics , having noticed him in his unreleased debut film, Moonwalk .  Hariprashanth Varm's character look came out as location pictures in February 2023.  Sanjana Chandran, a dancer and transwoman, secured a role in the cast and made her acting debut.  Television actress Suchitra Nair was cast by Pellissery after he spotted her on the Malayalam reality TV show Bigg Boss (season 4) , marking her film debut.  Hareesh Peradi , Manikandan R. Achari , and Rajeev Pillai was also cast in undisclosed roles.  Bharatanatyam dancer Shanta Dhananjayan plays a kalaripayattu gurukkal in the film.  Deepali Vashistha, a belly dancer was also cast in the film.  Russian yoga teacher, dancer, and model Diana Nasonova played another role.  Filming [ edit ] Jaisalmer was a major location.

Rafeeque also contributed the lyrics for all songs, except "Madabhare Naina" by Preeti Pillai and "Shabnami" by Varun Grover . The initial composition of four songs—"Punnara Kattile Poovanatthil", "Raakk", "Thaayum", and "Ezhimala Kottayile"—were done by Rafeeque. The soundtrack album, distributed by the record label Saregama , was preceded with three singles: "Punnara Kattile Poovanatthil",  "Raakk"  and "Madabhara Mizhiyoram".  The full album was released on 18 January 2024, which includes Malayalam and Hindi songs.  Marketing [ edit ] Following the unveiling of the fil's first-look poster in April 2023, a limited edition of 25 physical metal posters, autographed by Mohanlal and Pellissery, along with a digital collectible in the form of an NFT , verified through the Polygon blockchain were auctioned.    It received bids from over 30 countries.  In November 2023, the makers of the film collaborated with a United Kingdom-based company to release a DNFT (Decentralized Non-Fungible Token) of Malaikottai Vaaliban , offering an alternative to the centralised NFT.  In December 2023, a book titled The Making of Malaikottai Vaaliban , authored by Toby T. Arnold, was published in both paperback and Kindle editions. The book provides a detailed account of the behind-the-scenes work that went into the production of Malaikottai Vaaliban .  In the second week of January 2024, the makers released a childre's comic book titled Vaaliban Comix , featuring the character of Malaikottai Vaaliban as a superhero coming to the rescue of children in distress.  On 18 January 2024, the producers collaborated with Jain International School of Creative Arts and Manorama Online to organize a strongman competition called the "Strongman Challenge" at Bolgatty Palace , Kochi . Two distinct competitions were held, one for professional bodybuilders , powerlifters and weightlifters and another for sports enthusiasts in the general category. The winners were bestowed with the title of Mr. Vaaliban along with a cash prize. This event marked the first ever occurrence of a strongman competition in Kerala .  The European distributor RFT Films organized various events in the United Kingdom under the name of Vaaliban Festival, including fan meets and club nights.  An audio launch function was held on 19 January in Kochi, attended by the cast and crew.  It was telecast on Flowers TV . The fil's promotional materials were installed inside airport terminals .

Release [ edit ] Theatrical [ edit ] In June 2023, John mentioned that although they had not finalized a release date, the film can be expected by the end of 2023.

Home media [ edit ] The film was premiered on Disney+ Hotstar from 23 February 2024 in Malayalam and dubbed versions of Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Kannada languages.  Reception [ edit ] Critical reception [ edit ] Malaikottai Vaaliban received mixed reviews from critics. Sanjith Sridharan of OTTplay gave 4/5 stars and concluded, "Lijo Jose Pellisser's Malaikottai Vaaliban is a movie made keeping in minds fans of cinema – and not that of a superstar. With action and enough entertainment to keep the audience of the commercial cinema hooked, this visually-rich Malayalam period drama is another great addition to Lij's filmography and presents a memorable character for Mohanlal, who is in top form".  Arun Antony of Deccan Herald gave 4/5 stars and wrote  "Lijo impresses with a fictional period drama. The film offers a glimpse of what Lijo will bring to the table next but may not cater to Mohanlal fans seeking action and powerful dialogues."  S. Devasankar of Pinkvilla gave 3/5 stars and wrote, "Malaikottai Vaaliban is indeed a bold attempt in the fantasy genre by Lijo Jose Pellissery, a director known to keep experimenting with his films. Despite its flaws, Malaikottai Vaaliban is worth watching in theaters, especially for Madhu Neelakanda's cinematography and Prashant Pilla's music".  Gopika Is of The Times of India rated 3/5 stars and wrote "Lijo Jose Pellisher's Malaikottai Vaaliban is a mixed bag of swift and interesting action scenes, epic frames, peppy songs and quite some lag in the first half. While the basic story line, when you take Valiban out of the equation is't very original or even well defined, there are very interesting elements adding layers to it."  Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 3/5 stars and stated, "Unlike Mohanla's recent films, where makers often got carried away by either his stardom or his potential as a performer, Lijo Jose Pellisser's multi-genre movie strikes a fine balance between these aspects, while striving not to compromise on its overall quality".  K. Janaki of India Today gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote, 'Malaikottai Vaaliba' could have been a crisp film had the narrative had enough meat in the first half. However, the film sets up a great segue for the second part".  Sajin Shrijith of The New Indian Express gave 2/5 stars and wrote "A tiresome visual extravaganza with few joys. Lijo Jose Pellisser's new film is simply put, a movie with the sensibility of an elaborate play."  Nirmal Jovial of The Week gave 1.5/5 stars and wrote "Pellissery decided to create a film that is purposefully made slow. It is unlikely that this film will satisfy either of the [Mohanlal and Pellissery]fans."  Latha Srinivasan of Hindustan Times termed Mohanla's performance as the backbone of this fantasy entertainer and wrote "Called a fantasy entertainer, there are elements that work in Malaikottai Vaaliban and elements that clearly do't. Expect the unexpected".  Arjun Menon of Film Companion wrote "Lijo Jose Pellissery breaks down an epic her's journey tha's not afraid to breathe and take its own daring formal liberties. And this makes it a theatre experience unlike anything you would get to see on the big screen this year".  Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute stated that the film is like a "comic book style adventure film" and told that the film is "visually rich but underwhelming".  Princy Alexander of Onmanorama wrote "There are times when Lijo tries to tell the story through the frames alone, which affects the storytelling. But rest assured, there are some twists that make the film worth the experience and eager for a second part."  S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote "Filmmaker Lijo Jose Pellissery tries something new with the Mohanlal-starrer, and the cinephile in him is on ample display with nods to yesteryear classics, but what we are finally left with is an underwhelmed feeling".  Analysing the movie for Onmanorama , Sajesh Mohan wrote about how Lijo used colours to narrate different stages of his folklore, "Lij's colour-coding in ‘Malaikottai Vaaliban’ adds an intriguing dimension. When Vaaliba's combat is primarily physical, colours are gradually introduced until they culminate in red and black. However, when Vaaliban faces a group of treacherous adversaries driven by jealousy, the dominant colour becomes yellow."  Box office [ edit ] Malaikottai Vaaliban debuted by collecting ₹ 5.85 crore in Kerala and with additional earnings from overseas and GCC, the film amassed a total gross collection of ₹ 12.27 crore on its opening day, securing its place as the fourth highest opening grosser among Mohanla's films.  As of 30 January 2024, the film grossed ₹21.75 crore.  By 8 February 2024, the film grossed ₹28.40 crore.  and by 13 February 2024, the fil's estimated gross was ₹30 crore.  Future [ edit ] In the third week of January 2024, it was reported that Malaikottai Vaaliban is designed as a two-part film and would be followed by a second film.  When asked, Pellissery commented that, "we hope we can give you more surprises once the film releases".  A sequel titled Malaikottai Vaaliban II was announced in the end credits of the film.
